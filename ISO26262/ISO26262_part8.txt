# Foreword

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.

The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are described in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular, the different approval criteria needed for the different types of ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the editorial rules of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 (see www.iso.org/directives).

# Introduction

The ISO 26262 series of standards is the adaptation of IEC 61508 series of standards to address the sector specific needs of electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems within road vehicles. This adaptation applies to all activities during the safety lifecycle of safety-related systems comprised of electrical, electronic and software components.

Safety is one of the key issues in the development of road vehicles. Development and integration of automotive functionalities strengthen the need for functional safety and the need to provide evidence that functional safety objectives are satisfied.

With the trend of increasing technological complexity, software content and mechatronic implementation, there are increasing risks from systematic failures and random hardware failures, these being considered within the scope of functional safety. ISO 26262 series of standards includes guidance to mitigate these risks by providing appropriate requirements and processes.

To achieve functional safety, the ISO 26262 series of standards:

- a) provides a reference for the automotive safety lifecycle and supports the tailoring of the activities to be performed during the lifecycle phases, i.e., development, production, operation, service and decommissioning;
- b) provides an automotive-specific risk-based approach to determine integrity levels [Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs)];
- c) uses ASILs to specify which of the requirements of ISO 26262 are applicable to avoid unreasonable residual risk;
- d) provides requirements for functional safety management, design, implementation, verification, validation and confirmation measures; and
- e) provides requirements for relations between customers and suppliers.

The ISO 26262 series of standards is concerned with functional safety of E/E systems that is achieved through safety measures including safety mechanisms. It also provides a framework within which safety-related systems based on other technologies (e.g. mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic) can be considered.

The achievement of functional safety is influenced by the development process (including such activities as requirements specification, design, implementation, integration, verification, validation and configuration), the production and service processes and the management processes.

Safety is intertwined with common function-oriented and quality-oriented activities and work products. The ISO 26262 series of standards addresses the safety-related aspects of these activities and work products.

Figure 1 shows the overall structure of the ISO 26262 series of standards. The ISO 26262 series of standards is based upon a V-model as a reference process model for the different phases of product development. Within the figure:

- — the shaded “V”s represent the interconnection among ISO 26262-3, ISO 26262-4, ISO 26262-5, ISO 26262-6 and ISO 26262-7;
- — for motorcycles:
- - — ISO 26262-12:2018, Clause 8 supports ISO 26262-3;
- — ISO 26262-12:2018, Clauses 9 and 10 support ISO 26262-4;

— the specific clauses are indicated in the following manner: “m-n”, where “m” represents the number of the particular part and “n” indicates the number of the clause within that part.

# Part 8: Supporting processes

# 1 Scope

This document is intended to be applied to safety-related systems that include one or more electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems and that are installed in series production road vehicles, excluding mopeds. This document does not address unique E/E systems in special vehicles such as E/E systems designed for drivers with disabilities.

NOTE Other dedicated application-specific safety standards exist and can complement the ISO 26262 series of standards or vice versa.

Systems and their components released for production, or systems and their components already under development prior to the publication date of this document, are exempted from the scope of this edition. This document addresses alterations to existing systems and their components released for production prior to the publication of this document by tailoring the safety lifecycle depending on the alteration. This document addresses integration of existing systems not developed according to this document and systems developed according to this document by tailoring the safety lifecycle.

This document addresses possible hazards caused by malfunctioning behaviour of safety-related E/E systems, including interaction of these systems. It does not address hazards related to electric shock, fire, smoke, heat, radiation, toxicity, flammability, reactivity, corrosion, release of energy and similar hazards, unless directly caused by malfunctioning behaviour of safety-related E/E systems.

This document describes a framework for functional safety to assist the development of safety-related E/E systems. This framework is intended to be used to integrate functional safety activities into a company-specific development framework. Some requirements have a clear technical focus to implement functional safety into a product; others address the development process and can therefore be seen as process requirements in order to demonstrate the capability of an organization with respect to functional safety.

# 4 Requirements for compliance

# 4.1 Purpose

This clause describes how:

- a) to achieve compliance with the ISO 26262 series of standards;
- b) to interpret the tables used in the ISO 26262 series of standards; and
- c) to interpret the applicability of each clause, depending on the relevant ASIL(s).

# 4.2 General requirements

When claiming compliance with the ISO 26262 series of standards, each requirement shall be met, unless one of the following applies:

- a) tailoring of the safety activities in accordance with ISO 26262-2 has been performed that shows that the requirement does not apply; or

© ISO 2018 – All rights reserved
---
ISO 26262-8:2018(E)

b) a rationale is available that the non-compliance is acceptable and the rationale has been evaluated in accordance with ISO 26262-2.

Informative content, including notes and examples, is only for guidance in understanding, or for clarification of the associated requirement, and shall not be interpreted as a requirement itself or as complete or exhaustive.

The results of safety activities are given as work products. “Prerequisites” are information which shall be available as work products of a previous phase. Given that certain requirements of a clause are ASIL-dependent or may be tailored, certain work products may not be needed as prerequisites.

“Further supporting information” is information that can be considered, but which in some cases is not required by the ISO 26262 series of standards as a work product of a previous phase and which may be made available by external sources that are different from the persons or organizations responsible for the functional safety activities.

# 4.3 Interpretations of tables

Tables are normative or informative depending on their context. The different methods listed in a table contribute to the level of confidence in achieving compliance with the corresponding requirement. Each method in a table is either:

- a) a consecutive entry (marked by a sequence number in the leftmost column, e.g. 1, 2, 3), or
- b) an alternative entry (marked by a number followed by a letter in the leftmost column, e.g. 2a, 2b, 2c).

For consecutive entries, all listed highly recommended and recommended methods in accordance with the ASIL apply. It is allowed to substitute a highly recommended or recommended method by others not listed in the table, in this case, a rationale shall be given describing why these comply with the corresponding requirement. If a rationale can be given to comply with the corresponding requirement without choosing all entries, a further rationale for omitted methods is not necessary.

For alternative entries, an appropriate combination of methods shall be applied in accordance with the ASIL indicated, independent of whether they are listed in the table or not. If methods are listed with different degrees of recommendation for an ASIL, the methods with the higher recommendation should be preferred. A rationale shall be given that the selected combination of methods or even a selected single method complies with the corresponding requirement.

NOTE A rationale based on the methods listed in the table is sufficient. However, this does not imply a bias for or against methods not listed in the table.

For each method, the degree of recommendation to use the corresponding method depends on the ASIL and is categorized as follows:

- — “++” indicates that the method is highly recommended for the identified ASIL;
- — “+” indicates that the method is recommended for the identified ASIL; and
- — “o” indicates that the method has no recommendation for or against its usage for the identified ASIL.

# 4.4 ASIL-dependent requirements and recommendations

The requirements or recommendations of each sub-clause shall be met for ASIL A, B, C and D, if not stated otherwise. These requirements and recommendations refer to the ASIL of the safety goal.

If ASIL decomposition has been performed at an earlier stage of development, in accordance with ISO 26262-9:2018, Clause 5, the ASIL resulting from the decomposition shall be met.

If an ASIL is given in parentheses in the ISO 26262 series of standards, the corresponding sub-clause shall be considered as a recommendation rather than a requirement for this ASIL. This has no link with the parenthesis notation related to ASIL decomposition.

# 4.5   Adaptation for motorcycles

For items or elements of motorcycles for which requirements of ISO 26262-12 are applicable, the requirements of ISO 26262-12 supersede the corresponding requirements in this document. Requirements of ISO 26262-2 that are superseded by ISO 26262-12 are defined in Part 12.

# 4.6   Adaptation for trucks, buses, trailers and semi-trailers

Content that is intended to be unique for trucks, buses, trailers and semi-trailers (T&amp;B) is indicated as such.

# 5   Interfaces within distributed developments

# 5.1   Objectives

The objectives of this clause are:

- a)  to define the interactions and dependencies between customers and suppliers for development activities;
- b)  to describe the allocation of responsibilities; and
- c)  to identify the work products to be exchanged for distributed developments of an item and its elements.

# 5.2   General

The customer (e.g. vehicle manufacturer) and the suppliers for item or element developments jointly comply with the requirements specified in the ISO 26262 series of standards for distributed developments. Responsibilities are agreed between the customer and the suppliers for the concept, development, production, operation, service and decommissioning phases of the safety lifecycle. Subcontractor relationships are permitted. The customer has safety-related procedures concerning planning, execution and documentation for in-house item developments, therefore comparable procedures apply for co-operation with the supplier on distributed item developments. The same applies for item developments where the supplier has the full responsibility for functional safety.

NOTE 1    The Development Interface Agreement (DIA) aims to describe the roles and responsibilities between the customer and supplier. Consequently the safety planning by the customer and supplier is in line with the DIA.

NOTE 2    This clause is not relevant for the procurement which do not place any responsibility for safety on the supplier, including standard components and parts or development commissions.

NOTE 3    This note applies to T&amp;B: this clause is not relevant for body builder equipment being integrated into base vehicles. Clause 15 applies when integrating body builder equipment developed according to ISO 26262 into a base vehicle which is in scope of another standard. Clause 16 applies when body builder equipment developed according to another standard is integrated into a base vehicle developed according to ISO 26262.

# Specification and management of safety requirements

# 6.1

# Objectives

The objectives of this clause are:

- a) to ensure the correct specification of safety requirements with respect to their attributes and characteristics; and
- b) to ensure consistent management of safety requirements throughout the entire safety lifecycle.

# 6.2

# General

Safety requirements are requirements aimed at achieving and ensuring the required level of functional safety.

During the safety lifecycle, safety requirements are specified and detailed in a hierarchical structure. The structure and dependencies of safety requirements used in the ISO 26262 series of standards are illustrated in Figure 2. The safety requirements are allocated or distributed among the elements.

The management of safety requirements includes obtaining agreement on them, obtaining commitments from those implementing the safety requirements, and maintaining traceability.

In order to support the management of safety requirements, the use of suitable requirements management tools is recommended.

The specific requirements concerning the content of the safety requirements at different hierarchical levels are listed in ISO 26262-3, ISO 26262-4, ISO 26262-5 and ISO 26262-6.

# 6.4 Requirements and recommendations

# 6.4.1 Specification of safety requirements

To achieve the characteristics of safety requirements listed in 6.4.2.4, safety requirements shall be specified by an appropriate combination of:

- a) natural language; and
- b) methods listed in Table 1.

| Methods                                                           | A  | B  | ASIL C | D  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -- | -- | ------ | -- |
| 1a Informal notations for requirements specificationa, b          | ++ | ++ | +      | +  |
| 1b Semi-formal notations for requirements specificationa, b, c, d | +  | +  | ++     | ++ |
| 1c Formal notations for requirements specificationa               | +  | +  | +      | +  |

a An appropriate selection of methods for the specification of safety requirement considers their adequacy to achieve the characteristics of safety requirement according to 6.4.2 for a specific issue to be specified, its complexity or the knowledge of the persons specifying or managing safety requirements. Examples include the use of state graphs or diagrams for specifying the complex behaviour of software or hardware including many states or/and complex transitions.

b For higher level safety requirements (e.g. safety goals, functional and technical safety requirements) natural language and other types of informal notations are the most appropriate forms, though some requirements may be better handled with semi-formal notations.

c Semi-formal notation formulates requirements using natural language that is supplemented by mathematical or graphical elements such as equations, graphs, diagrams, flow charts, timing diagrams, and many other forms of representation (e.g. UML® and SysML™). Examples include model-based techniques and applying templates and controlled vocabulary for requirement sentences in natural language.

d For lower-level safety requirements where precise hardware and software behaviours and capabilities may be specified, semi-formal notations are more appropriate due to greater clarity. However, even here it may not be possible or necessary to use semi-formal techniques for every requirement.

# 6.4.2 Attributes and characteristics of safety requirements

# 6.4.2.1

Safety requirements shall be unambiguously identifiable as safety requirements.

NOTE In order to comply with this requirement, safety requirements can be listed in a separate document. If safety requirements and other requirements are administered in the same document, safety requirements can be identified explicitly by using a special attribute as described in 6.4.2.5.

# 6.4.2.2

Safety requirements shall inherit the ASIL from the safety requirements from which they are derived, except if ASIL decomposition is applied in accordance with ISO 26262-9.

NOTE As safety goals are the top level safety requirements, the inheritance of ASILs starts at the safety goal level.

# 6.4.2.3

Safety requirements shall be allocated to the item or element which implements them.

# 6.4.2.4

Safety requirements shall have the following characteristics:

NOTE 1 The characteristics for safety requirements enable clear communication to the stakeholders. They are the principle means of communicating the safety requirements to those who must implement them. The characteristics cited below are consistent with those referenced by ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 (see Reference [8]).

- a) unambiguous;

© ISO 2018 – All rights reserved
---
# ISO 26262-8:2018(E)

NOTE 2 A requirement is unambiguous if there is a common understanding of the meaning of the requirement.

1. comprehensible;
NOTE 3 A requirement is comprehensible if the stakeholders and the consumers of that requirement understand its meaning.
2. atomic (singular);
NOTE 4 Safety requirements at one hierarchical level are atomic when they are formulated in such a way that they cannot be divided into at least two independent safety requirements at the considered level. The achievement of this characteristic could contradict the achievement of the other essential characteristics of safety requirements. In such a case, atomicity can be considered as having less importance.
3. internally consistent;
NOTE 5 A requirement is internally consistent if it contains no contradictions within itself.
4. feasible and achievable;
NOTE 6 A requirement is feasible if it can be implemented within the constraints of the item development (resources, state-of-the-art, etc.).

NOTE 7 A requirement can be accomplished technically, it does not require major technology advances, and fits within item constraints (e.g., cost schedule, technical, legal, regulatory, etc.) acceptably.
5. verifiable;
NOTE 8 A requirement is verifiable if means, at the level where it is specified, are available to check that the requirement is fulfilled.

NOTE 9 Collected evidence pertaining to an item shows the corresponding requirement has been satisfied. Verifiability is enhanced when the requirement is measurable.
6. necessary;
NOTE 10 The requirement defines an essential capability, characteristic, constraint, and/or quality factor. If it is removed or deleted, a deficiency will exist which is not fulfilled by other capabilities of the product or process.

NOTE 11 The requirement is currently applicable and has not been made obsolete by the passage of time. Requirements with planned expiration dates or applicability dates are clearly identified.
7. implementation free;
NOTE 12 The requirement, while addressing what is necessary and sufficient for the item, avoids placing unnecessary constraints on the architectural design. The objective is to be implementation independent. The requirement states what is required, not how the requirement should be met.
8. complete; and
NOTE 13 The stated requirement is clear without further amplification because it is measurable and sufficiently describes the capability and characteristics required to meet the stakeholder’s need.
9. conforming.
NOTE 14 The stated requirement conforms to applicable government, automotive industry and product standards, specifications and interfaces for which compliance is required.

# 6.4.2.5 Safety requirements shall have the following attributes:

1. a unique identification remaining unchanged throughout the safety lifecycle;

© ISO 2018 – All rights reserved
---
# ISO 26262-8:2018(E)

# EXAMPLE 1

A unique identification of a requirement can be achieved in a variety of ways, such as subscripting each instance of the word “shall”, e.g. “The system shall9782 check …”, or numbering consecutively each sentence containing the word “shall”, e.g. “9782 In the case of ... the system shall check ...”.

# b)

a status; and

# EXAMPLE 2

A status of a safety requirement can be “proposed”, “assumed”, “accepted”, “reviewed”, “delivered” or “verified”.

# c)

an ASIL.

The set of safety requirements for an item, an element, which are derived from one or more safety goals shall have the following properties:

- a) hierarchical structure;
- NOTE 1 Hierarchical structure means that safety requirements are structured in several successive levels as presented in Figure 2. These levels are always aligned to comply with the corresponding design phases. It is possible that there could be several levels of hierarchy within any of the design phases of Figure 2.

b) organizational structure according to an appropriate grouping scheme;
- NOTE 2 Organization of safety requirements means that safety requirements within each level are grouped together, usually corresponding to the architecture.

c) completeness;
- NOTE 3 Completeness means that the safety requirements at one level fully implement all safety requirements of the previous level.

d) external consistency;
- NOTE 4 Unlike internal consistency, in which an individual safety requirement does not contradict itself, external consistency means that multiple safety requirements do not contradict each other.

e) no duplication of information within any level of the hierarchical structure; and
- NOTE 5 No duplication of information means that the content of safety requirements is not repeated in any other safety requirement at one single level of the hierarchical structure and this is true at each hierarchical level.

f) maintainability.

# 6.4.3.2

Safety requirements shall be traceable with a reference being made to:

- a) each source of a safety requirement at the next upper hierarchical level;
- b) each derived safety requirement at the next lower hierarchical level, or to its realisation in the design; and
- c) the verification specification in accordance with 9.4.2.

NOTE 1 Various types of traceability records such as requirement management system, electronic materials, etc., can be used.

# ISO 26262-8:2018(E)

NOTE 2 Traceability supports:

- the achievement of consistency between a requirement, its realisation and verification,
- the effectiveness of an impact analysis if changes are made to particular safety requirements, and
- the execution of confirmation measures (e.g. functional safety assessment to evaluate the achieved functional safety).

# 6.4.3.3

An appropriate combination of the verification methods listed in Table 2 shall be applied to verify that the safety requirements comply with the requirements in this clause and that they comply with the specific requirements on the verification of safety requirements within the respective parts of the ISO 26262 series of standards where safety requirements are derived.

# 6.4.3.4

Safety requirements shall be placed under configuration management in accordance with Clause 7 to maintain consistency throughout the safety lifecycle.

EXAMPLE When the safety requirements at a lower level are consistent with the higher level safety requirements, the configuration management can define a baseline as the basis for subsequent phases of the safety lifecycle.

# ISO 26262-8:2018(E)

# 9.2 General

Verification is applicable to the following phases of the safety lifecycle:

1. in the concept phase, verification ensures that the concept is correct, complete and consistent with respect to the boundary conditions of the item, and that the defined boundary conditions themselves are correct, complete and consistent, so that the concept can be realised;
2. in the product development phase, verification is conducted in different forms, as described below:
- In the design phases, verification is the evaluation of the work products, such as requirement specification, architectural design, models, or software code, thus ensuring that they comply with previously established requirements for correctness, completeness and consistency. Evaluation can be performed by review, simulation or analysis techniques. The evaluation is planned, specified, executed and documented in a systematic manner.

NOTE Design phases are ISO 26262-4:2018, Clause 6, ISO 26262-5:2018, Clause 7, ISO 26262-6:2018, Clause 7 and ISO 26262-6:2018, Clause 8.
- In the test phases, verification is the evaluation of the work products, items and elements within a test environment to ensure that they comply with their requirements. The tests are planned, specified, executed, evaluated and documented in a systematic manner.
3. In the production and operation phase, verification ensures that:
- the safety-related special characteristics are appropriately met during production,
- the safety-related information is appropriately provided in the user manuals and in the repair and maintenance instructions; and
- the safety-related properties of the item are met by the application of control measures within the production process.

NOTE This is a generic verification process that is instantiated by phases of the safety lifecycle in ISO 26262-3, ISO 26262-4, ISO 26262-5, ISO 26262-6 and ISO 26262-7. Safety validation is not addressed by this process. See ISO 26262-4:2018, Clause 8, for further details.

g) the criteria to determine the test case as passed or failed.

# 9.4.2.3

For testing, test cases shall be grouped according to the test methods to be applied, considering the following aspects:

# 10 Documentation management

# 10.1 Objectives

The objective is to develop a documentation management strategy for the entire safety lifecycle in order to facilitate an effective and repeatable documentation management process.

# 10.2 General

Documentation management is a well-established practice within the automotive industry and can be applied in accordance with a quality management system (e.g. IATF 16949 [6] or ISO 9001[3]) or related standard (e.g. ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 [4]).

The documentation requirements in the ISO 26262 series of standards focus mainly on content, and not on layout and appearance.

The information need not be made available in physical documents. The documentation can take various forms and structures and tools can be used to generate documents automatically.

EXAMPLE Possible forms are: paper, electronic media, databases.

What is deemed adequate information depends on a variety of factors, including the complexity, the extent of the safety-related systems/subsystems, and the requirements relating to the special application.

Duplication of information within a document, and between documents, should be avoided to aid maintainability.

NOTE An alternative to duplicating information is the use of a cross-reference within one document, directing the reader to the information source document.

# 11 Confidence in the use of software tools

# 11.1 Objectives

The objectives of this clause are:

- a) to provide criteria to determine the required level of confidence in a software tool when applicable; and
- b) to provide means for the qualification of the software tool when applicable, in order to create evidence that the software tool is suitable to be used to support the activities or tasks required by the ISO 26262 series of standards (i.e. the user can rely on the correct functioning of a software tool for those activities or tasks required by the ISO 26262 series of standards).

# 11.2 General

A software tool used in the development of a system or its software or hardware elements can support the activities and tasks required by ISO 26262. In such cases, confidence is needed that the software tool effectively achieves the following goals:

- a) the risk of systematic faults in the developed product due to malfunctions of the software tool leading to erroneous outputs is minimized; and
- b) the development process is adequate with respect to compliance with the ISO 26262 series of standards, if activities or tasks required by the ISO 26262 series of standards rely on the correct functioning of the software tool used.

NOTE 1 A “software tool” can vary from a stand-alone software package to a suite of software tools integrated into a tool-chain.

EXAMPLE 1 Commercial tools, open source tools, freeware tools, shareware tools or tools developed in-house by the user.

To determine the required level of confidence in a software tool used within development under the conditions mentioned above, the following criteria are evaluated:

- — the possibility that the malfunctioning software tool and its corresponding erroneous output can introduce or fail to detect errors in a safety-related item or element being developed; and
- — the confidence in preventing or detecting such errors in its corresponding output.

The tool may pre-exist or be developed upon request, based on the tool user requirements.

© ISO 2018 – All rights reserved

# ISO 26262-8:2018(E)

The confidence in the use of software tools is composed of two groups of activities which are shown in Figure 3:

# a) Tool usage aspects

- Evaluation of the software tool usage is based on the tool’s required functions and properties. The determination of the corresponding Tool Confidence Level (TCL) is based on analysis classes, Tool Impact (TI), and Tool error Detection (TD). The determination of TI and TD depends on the development process of the element developed and/or verified with the tool.
- Integration of the software tool into the user’s environment according to the results of the evaluation and qualification (see 11.4.2 and 11.4.3).
EXAMPLE 2: The tool could need to be integrated with configuration management tools, authoring tools or compilers.
- Verify that the tool is working appropriately in the user environment. Check the validity of the predetermined Tool Confidence Level or qualification (11.4.2) and if required perform qualification procedures in the user environment.
EXAMPLE 3: Test of the tool performed in the user environment for representative use cases.

EXAMPLE 4: Run the tool validation test suite.
- Appropriate usage of the tool: operating the tool in the user environment for performing the development/verification tasks that this tool automates according to the defined procedure (see 11.4.3).

# b) Tool qualification aspects

- Tool qualification is carried out based on given or assumed information regarding the tool usage (e.g. use cases, user requirements, TCL, ASIL).

The rigour of requirements placed upon the tool should not be biased by whether the tool pre-exists or is custom-made. Instead, the requirements depend on the role of the tool, the risks related to tool failures and the maximum ASIL of the item or element.

NOTE 2: This approach aims to avoid excessive requirements for tools with low impact developed specifically for E/E systems. It also aims to reduce any bias from the assumption that pre-existing tools do not require appropriate rigour of requirements.

# Figure 3 — Overview of Tool Confidence activities

© ISO 2018 – All rights reserved
---
# ISO 26262-8:2018(E)

To evaluate the confidence in prevention or detection measures, measures internal to the software tool (e.g. monitoring) as well as measures external to the software tool (e.g. guidelines, tests, reviews) implemented in the development process of the safety-related item or element are considered and can be assessed. The tool evaluation process, determination of its Tool Confidence Level (TCL) and corresponding qualification are shown in Figure 4.

# 11.4 Requirements and recommendations

# 11.4.1 General requirement

If the safety lifecycle incorporates the use of a software tool for the development of a system, or its hardware or software elements, such that activities or tasks required by the ISO 26262 series of standards rely on the correct functioning of a software tool, and where the relevant outputs of that tool are not examined or verified for the applicable process step(s), such software tools shall comply with the requirements of this clause.

# 11.4.2 Validity of predetermined Tool Confidence Level or qualification

If the confidence level evaluation or qualification of a software tool is performed independently from the development of a particular safety-related item or element, the validity of this predetermined Tool Confidence Level or qualification shall be verified prior to the software tool being used for the development of a particular safety-related item or element.

NOTE The collection of information about the software tools, the confidence level evaluation and the qualification can be a cross-organizational activity, thus facilitating the effort for each development project.

# 11.4.3 Software tool compliance with its evaluation criteria or its qualification

When using a software tool, it shall be ensured that its usage, its determined environmental and functional constraints and its general operating conditions comply with its evaluation criteria or its qualification.

EXAMPLE Use of identical version and configuration settings for the use cases together with the implemented measures for the prevention or detection of malfunctions and their corresponding erroneous output, as documented in the qualification report for this software tool.

# 11.4.4 Planning of usage of a software tool

# 11.4.4.1

The usage of a software tool shall be planned, including the determination of:

- a) the identification and version number of the software tool;
- b) the configuration of the software tool;
EXAMPLE 1 The configuration of a compiler is defined by setting compiler switches and “#pragma” statements in a C source file.
- c) the use cases of the software tool;
NOTE 1 Use cases can describe the user’s interactions with a software tool and the applied subset of the software tool’s functionality when performing activities of the safety lifecycle.

NOTE 2 Use cases can include requirements for the configuration of the software tool and the environment in which the software tool is executed.

f) the methods to qualify the software tool, if required, based on the determined level of confidence and ASIL.

# 11.4.4.2

To ensure the proper evaluation or usage of the software tool, the following information shall be available:

- a description of the features, functions and technical properties of the software tool;
- the user manual or other usage guides, if applicable;
- a description of the environment required for its operation;
- a description of the expected behaviour of the software tool under anomalous operating conditions, if applicable;

EXAMPLE 1 Anomalous operating conditions can be prohibited combinations of compiler switches, an environment not complying with the user manual or an incorrect installation.

EXAMPLE 2 Expected behaviour under an anomalous operating condition can be a suppression of output generation, a user indication or a user report.

- a description of known software tool malfunctions and the appropriate safeguards, avoidance or workaround measures, if applicable; and

EXAMPLE 3 Usage guidelines or workarounds addressing known malfunctions, limitation of code optimisation by compilers or the use of a limited set of building blocks for modelling.

EXAMPLE 4 Safeguards include prevention through usage constraints, detection, reporting of all known malfunctions and issues, and provision of safe alternate techniques to perform the corresponding activity.

- the measures for the prevention or detection of malfunctions and the corresponding erroneous output of the software tool identified during the determination of the required level of confidence for this software tool.

NOTE 1 Measures for the prevention or detection of erroneous corresponding outputs can address both known and potential errors in the output of software tools.

EXAMPLE 5 Comparisons of outputs of redundant software tools, tests performed, static analyses or reviews, analyses of log files of the software tool, avoidance of functionalities with known issues.

# 11.4.5

# Evaluation of a software tool by analysis

# 11.4.5.1

The description of the usage of a software tool shall contain the following information:

- the intended purpose;

EXAMPLE 1 Simulation of a function, the generation of source code, or the test of embedded software, the tailoring of the safety-lifecycle or the simplification or automation of activities and tasks required by ISO 26262.

- the inputs and expected outputs; and

EXAMPLE 2 Data required as input for a subsequent development activity, source code, results of a simulation, results of a test, or other work products of ISO 26262.

# 11.4.5.2

The intended usage of the software tool shall be analysed and evaluated to determine:

1. the possibility that a malfunction of a particular software tool can introduce or fail to detect errors in
a safety-related item or element being developed. This is expressed by the classes of Tool Impact (TI):
- TI1 shall be selected when there is an argument that there is no such possibility;
- TI2 shall be selected in all other cases.
2. the confidence in measures that prevent the software tool from malfunctioning and producing
corresponding erroneous output, or in measures that detect that the software tool has
malfunctioned and has produced corresponding erroneous output. This is expressed by the classes
of Tool error Detection (TD):
- TD1 shall be selected if there is a high degree of confidence that a malfunction and its
corresponding erroneous output will be prevented or detected;
- TD2 shall be selected if there is a medium degree of confidence that a malfunction and its
corresponding erroneous output will be prevented or detected;
- TD3 shall be selected in all other cases.

NOTE 1 Prevention or detection can be accomplished through process steps, redundancy in tasks or software
tools or by rationality checks within the software tool itself.

NOTE 2 TD3 typically applies if there are no systematic measures in the development process available, and
therefore malfunctions of the software tool and their corresponding erroneous outputs can only be detected
randomly.

NOTE 3 If a software tool is used to verify the output from another software tool, the interdependency
between those software tools is considered when evaluating the subsequent software tool and an adequate TD is
selected for the software tool used subsequently. For instance, interdependency between tools can exist because
of common components or shared resources.

NOTE 4 The level of detail for such a usage analysis only needs to permit the proper determination of both of
the classes of TI and TD.

EXAMPLE 1 TD1 is selected for a code generator when the generated source code is verified in accordance
with ISO 26262. TD3 is selected for a code generator when the generated source code is not verified.

EXAMPLE 2 Usage guidelines prevent malfunctions such as the incorrect or ambiguous interpretation of code
constructs by a compiler.

EXAMPLE 3 TD2 is selected for a tool that statically verifies the absence in source code of potential for division
by zero if testing is also applied for this purpose. TD3 is selected if absence of division by zero is verified by the
tool alone.

# 11.4.5.3

If the correct selection of TI or TD is unclear or doubtful, TI and TD should be estimated conservatively.

# 11.4.5.4

Based on the values determined for the classes of TI and TD (in accordance with 11.4.5.2, or
11.4.5.3), the required software Tool Confidence Level shall be determined according to Table 3.

# Evaluation of hardware elements

# 13.1 Objectives

The objective of this clause is to ensure that the functional behaviour is adequate to meet the allocated safety requirements and therefore the risk of a violation of a safety goal or of a safety requirement, due to a systematic fault of the hardware element, is sufficiently low. Suitability for use based on random fault management is established by the integrator of the evaluated hardware element, at the next highest level of design integration.

NOTE 1 Meeting the requirements of the safety concept includes providing information on failure modes and failure mode distribution of the hardware element, suitable to conduct hardware failure analysis.

NOTE 2 It is not the objective of this clause to ensure the suitability of the hardware element concerning its robustness in its intended environmental conditions or its reliability. This is addressed for every hardware element within ISO 26262-5:2018, Clause 10.

In this clause, the use of the term “hardware element” refers either to COTS hardware components or parts, or to custom hardware components or parts, that:

- — are not originally developed or designed according to the ISO 26262 series of standards; and
- — are considered to be safety-related within the context of the ISO 26262 compliant item or element into which they are to be integrated.

More precisely, the evaluation of hardware elements is an alternative means of compliance with ISO 26262-5. The hardware elements eligible for evaluation can either be specific to an application.

© ISO 2018 – All rights reserved
---
# ISO 26262-8:2018(E)

or standard elements. Such elements are often developed for use across many industries either for automotive application or non-automotive application.

# 13.2 General

The following goals are achieved by the evaluation of hardware elements:

- a) provide evidence that the hardware possesses an adequate functional performance and therefore is suitable to provide its intended function as required by the hardware design;
- b) identification of new or confirmation of known failure modes and models (including the quantification of their distribution) by using appropriate tests (such as over limit test, accelerated test, etc.) or analyses;
- c) identification of new or confirmation of known limits of use for hardware elements; and
- d) provide an argument that the risk of a violation of a safety goal or the risk of a violation of a safety requirement due to systematic faults is sufficiently low.

The evaluation of hardware elements is done in the context of a specific application.

Within the evaluation of hardware elements the hardware element under consideration is classified either as class I, class II or class III element depending on its properties. These classes reflect the difficulty of the verification of the safety-related functionality and the role of the hardware element within the safety concept.

Depending on its class, different requirements to evaluate the hardware element are given. As a first step the relevant requirements for the hardware element are specified and its safety related failure modes are identified.

For the evaluation of class I elements it is sufficient to test the hardware element into which the evaluated hardware elements are integrated according to ISO 26262-5:2018, Clause 10.

The evaluation of class II elements can be done with a combination of tests and analyses.

For the evaluation of class III elements, in addition to the evaluation activities necessary for a class II element, an argument is added showing that the risk of a safety goal violation or the risk of a safety requirement violation is sufficiently low.

# 13.3 Inputs to this clause

# 13.4.1.1 Classification of the evaluated hardware element

The hardware element shall be classified as one of the following classes:

- a) Class I if:

- safety related failure modes can be identified and evaluated without knowledge about details of the implementation and the production process of the element; and
- the element has no internal safety mechanisms which are relevant for the safety concept to control or detect internal failures.

NOTE This does not include safety mechanisms that monitor properties outside of the element.

EXAMPLE Resistor, capacitor, transistor, diode, quartz, resonator.
- b) Class II if:
- the element has e.g. few operating modes, small value ranges, few parameters and can be analysed from safety perspective without knowing implementation details;
- available documentation allows valid assumptions supporting evaluation of systematic faults by testing and analysis without knowledge about details of the implementation and the production process of the element; and
- EXAMPLE Datasheets, user manuals, application notes.

the element has no internal safety mechanisms which are relevant for the safety concept to control or detect internal failures.

NOTE This does not include safety mechanisms that monitor properties outside of the element.

EXAMPLE Fuel pressure sensor, temperature sensor, stand-alone Analog Digital Converter (ADC) without internal safety mechanisms relevant for the safety concept.
- c) Class III if:
- the element has e.g. many operating modes, wide value ranges or many parameters which are impossible to analyse without knowing implementation details,
- sources for systematic faults can only be understood and analysed by knowledge about detailed implementation, the development process and/or the production process, or
- the element has internal safety mechanisms which are relevant for the safety concept to control or detect internal failures.

# 13.4.4 Evaluation of class III hardware elements

# 13.4.4.1

Class III hardware elements should be developed in compliance with ISO 26262.

NOTE This means that the “evaluation of class III elements” is not the preferred approach and therefore the next version of the hardware element is planned to be developed in compliance with ISO 26262.

# 13.4.4.2

For the evaluation of the class III hardware elements the requirements stated in 13.4.3 shall be met.

# 13.4.4.3

NOTE 1 Depending on the combination of arguments provided, the result of the hardware evaluation shows that using the class III element in the context of the given application is safe. However the argument is not valid for all applications.

NOTE 2 Measures can include but are not limited to:

- a) verifiability of the safety related functionality;
- b) field experience/“well-trusted component”;
- NOTE Field experience can be used as a partial supporting argument for hardware evaluation. For a full proven-in-use argument, ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 14 is followed instead of this clause.

c) supervision by an independent diverse element with the capability to detect the safety related failure modes; and
- NOTE A Dependent Failure Analysis compliant with ISO 26262-9:2018, Clause 7, shows the independence.

# 14 Proven in use argument

# 14.1 Objectives

The objective of this clause is to provide guidance for a proven in use argument. A proven in use argument is an alternate means of compliance with the ISO 26262 series of standards that may be used in the case of reuse of existing items or elements when field data is available.

40 © ISO 2018 – All rights reserved
---
# ISO 26262-8:2018(E)

# 14.2 General

A proven in use argument can be applied to any type of product whose definition and conditions of use are identical to or have a very high degree of commonality with a product that is already released and in operation. It can also be applied to any work product related to such products.

NOTE 1 Proven in use argument is not inter-changeability: one product, with alternate design or implementation, that is intended to replace a proven in use product cannot be considered to be proven in use because it fulfils the original functional requirements, unless this product meets the criteria specified in this clause.

An item or an element, such as system, function, hardware or whole software product, can be a candidate for a proven in use argument. A candidate can also refer to a work product such as a technical safety concept.

The motivation for using the argument for proven in use includes:

- a) an automotive application in commercial use intended to be partly or completely carried over to another target, or
- b) an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) in operation intended to implement an additional function, or
- c) a candidate being in the field prior to the release of the ISO 26262 series of standards, or
- d) a candidate being used in other safety-related industries, or
- e) a candidate being a widely used COTS product not necessarily intended for automotive applications.

The proven in use argument is substantiated by appropriate documentation on the candidate, configuration management and change management records, and field data regarding safety-related incidents.

Once a candidate has been defined (see 14.4.3) with the expected proven in use credit (see 14.4.2), two important criteria need to be considered when preparing a proven in use argument:

- — the relevance of field data during the previous evaluation period of the candidate (see 14.4.5); and
- — the changes, if any, that could have impacted the candidate since its previous evaluation period (see 14.4.4).

NOTE 2 With regard to the relevance of field data, the proven in use argument is intended to address systematic and random failures of the candidate; it does not address failures related to ageing of the candidate.

Using proven in use items or elements does not exempt those items or elements from the following project-dependent safety management activities:

- — the proven in use credit is described in the safety plan; and
- — the data and work products resulting from the proven in use argument are part of the safety case and subject to confirmation measures.

# 14.3 Inputs to this clause

# 14.3.1 Prerequisites

The following information shall be available:

- — regarding the intended use of a candidate:

© ISO 2018 – All rights reserved
---
# ISO 26262-8:2018(E)

— foreseeable operational situation and intended operating modes and interfaces;

— regarding the previous use of a candidate:

— field data from the service period (from an external source).

# 14.3.2 Further supporting information

The following information can be considered regarding the previous use of a candidate:

— safety case in accordance with ISO 26262-2:2018, 6.5.4.

NOTE For a candidate not developed in accordance with the ISO 26262 series of standards (e.g. COTS products, candidates developed under a safety standard other than ISO 26262, such as IEC 61508 or RTCA DO-178C), some work products of the safety case may not be available, in which case they are substituted by available data resulting from the development of the candidate.

# 14.4 Requirements and recommendations

# 14.4.1 General

The following sub-clauses refer to the ASILs applicable to the future use of the candidate.

# 14.4.2 Proven in use credit

# 14.4.2.1

A proven in use credit shall be used only when the candidate complies with 14.4.2 to 14.4.5.

# 14.4.2.2

The proven in use credit resulting from a proven in use argument shall be planned in accordance with ISO 26262-2:2018, 6.4.5.

# 14.4.2.3

The proven in use credit shall be limited to the safety lifecycle sub-phases and activities covered by the proven in use argument of the candidate.

# 14.4.2.4

Integration measures of proven in use elements in an item or element shall be carried out at the appropriate level in accordance with ISO 26262-4:2018, Clause 8.

EXAMPLE The hardware of an ECU has a satisfactory field history and is intended to be 100 % carried over to a new application. The proven in use credit can be applied to the sub-phases and activities of development of this hardware element. Similarly, if the software is a 100 % carryover with a satisfactory service history, then the proven in use credit can also be applied to the software sub-phases and activities.

# 14.4.2.5

Safety validation of an item which embeds proven in use elements shall be carried out in accordance with ISO 26262-4:2018, Clause 9.

# 14.4.2.6

The confirmation measures of an item that embeds proven in use elements shall consider the proven in use arguments and related data in accordance with ISO 26262-2:2018, 6.4.9 and 6.4.10.

# 14.4.2.7

Any modification to a proven in use item or element shall comply with 14.4.4 for the corresponding proven in use credit to be maintained.

NOTE This clause applies to any type of modification including those initiated as a result of a safety-related incident.

# ISO 26262-8:2018(E)

# 14.4.3 Minimum information on candidate

A description of the candidate and its previous use shall be available, and includes:

- a) the identification and traceability of the candidate with a catalogue of internal elements or components, if any;
- b) the corresponding fit, form and function requirements that describe, if applicable, interface and environmental, physical and dimensional, functional and performance characteristics of the candidate; and
- c) the safety requirements of the candidate in the previous use and the corresponding ASILs, if available.

# 14.4.4 Analysis of modifications to the candidate

# 14.4.4.1 Proven in use candidates

Modifications to candidates and their environment shall be identified in accordance with 14.4.4.2 to 14.4.4.3.

NOTE 1 Modifications to candidates address design changes and implementation changes. Design changes can result from modification of requirements, functional enhancements or performance enhancement. Implementation changes do not affect specification or performance of the candidate but only its implementation features. Implementation changes can result from software corrections or use of new development or production tools.

NOTE 2 Changes to configuration data or calibration data are considered as modifications to the candidate when they impact its behaviour with regard to the violation of the safety goals.

NOTE 3 Changes to the environment of a candidate can result from use of this candidate in a new type of application with different safety goals or requirements, its installation in a new target environment (e.g. variant of vehicle, range of environmental conditions) or the upgrading of the components interacting with it or located in its vicinity.

# 14.4.4.2 Modifications to items introduced for a future application

Modifications to items and their environment introduced for the purpose of a future application shall comply with ISO 26262-2:2018, 6.4.3.

# 14.4.4.3 Modifications to elements introduced for a future application

Modifications to elements and their environment introduced for the purpose of a future application within a different item shall comply with ISO 26262-2:2018, 6.4.4.

# 14.4.4.4 Modifications to candidate independent of future application

Modifications to a candidate introduced after its evaluation period, independent of future applications, shall provide evidence that the proven in use status remains valid.

# 14.4.5 Analysis of field data

# 14.4.5.1 Configuration management and change management

Evidence shall be provided that the candidate has been kept under configuration management and change management during and after its evaluation period so that the current status of the candidate can be established.

# 14.4.5.2 Target values for proven in use

NOTE When any ASIL is not yet assigned to the candidate, ASIL D target is selected conservatively.

# 14.4.5.2.1

The rationale for the calculation of the evaluation period of the candidate shall be available.

# 14.4.5.2.2

The evaluation period of the candidate shall result from the addition of the observation period of all the specimens taken in reference in accordance with 14.4.5.2.3.

# 14.4.5.2.3

The observation period of each specimen with the same specification and realization as the candidate and running in a vehicle shall exceed the average yearly vehicle operating time before being considered in the analysis of the evaluation period of the candidate.

# 14.4.5.2.4

For a proven in use status to be obtained by the candidate, its evaluation period shall demonstrate compliance with each safety goal that can be violated by the candidate in accordance with Table 6 with a single-sided lower confidence level of 70 % (using a chi-square distribution).

NOTE 1 For the purpose of the proven in use argument, an observable incident means a failure that is reported to the manufacturer and caused by the candidate with the potential to lead to the violation of a safety goal.

| ASIL | Observable incident rate |
| ---- | ------------------------ |
| D    | <10−9/h                  |
| C    | <10−8/h                  |
| B    | <10−8/h                  |
| A    | <10−7/h                  |

NOTE 2 The character and rate of observable incidents are interpreted when analysing the potential violation of the safety goals in the field.

NOTE 3 Table 7 gives an example of the required minimum service period without observable incident which is necessary to achieve 70 % confidence.

| ASIL | Minimum evaluation period without observable incident |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| D    | 1,2 × 109 h                                           |
| C    | 1,2 × 108 h                                           |
| B    | 1,2 × 108 h                                           |
| A    | 1,2 × 107 h                                           |

NOTE 4 If observable incidents are found in the collected data of the specimens, the necessary minimum evaluation period, tservice, can be adjusted as follows:

tservice = tMTTF × (χCL;2 f +2)2

© ISO 2018 – All rights reserved
---
# ISO 26262-8:2018(E)

where

- CL is the confidence level as an absolute value (e.g. 0,7 for 70 %);
- tMTTF is the mean time to failure (1/failure rate);
- f is the number of safety-related incidents;
- (χ α ,ν )₂ is the chi-squared distribution with error probability α and ν degrees of freedom.

# 14.4.5.2.5

The application of the proven in use credit may be anticipated provisionally, before a proven in use status is obtained (in accordance with 14.4.5.2.4). In this case, the evaluation period of the candidate shall demonstrate compliance with each safety goal that can be violated by the candidate in accordance with Table 8 with a single sided lower confidence level of 70 % (using a chi-square distribution).

# Table 8 — Limits for observable incident rate (interim period)

| ASIL | Observable incident rate |
| ---- | ------------------------ |
| D    | <3 × 10−9/h              |
| C    | <3 × 10−8/h              |
| B    | <3 × 10−8/h              |
| A    | <3 × 10−7/h              |

# 14.4.5.2.6

In the case of any observed incident in the field during the interim period described in 14.4.5.2.5, the following shall be complied with:

- to stop using Table 8 for the observable incident rate and to use Table 6 for the candidate, or alternatively
- to provide evidence that the root cause of the observed incident is fully identified and eliminated in accordance with the ISO 26262 series of standards, and to keep on counting the cumulated hours for the candidate, to reset the counter of cumulated hours for this specific root cause and to record this evidence in the safety case.

# 14.4.5.2.7

In the case of a candidate with a non-constant failure rate, additional measures shall be applied for the proven in use argument, for instance in the case of damage resulting from fatigue.

NOTE Those measures apply to candidates with failure rates significantly dependent on factors such as wear, ageing or operating hours regarding the lifetime of the item. They can include dedicated endurance tests, or a longer observation period.

# 14.4.5.3 Field problems

The problem reporting system shall ensure that any observed incident with potential safety impact caused by the candidate in the field, is recorded and retrievable during the period of operation of the candidate (see ISO 26262-2:2018, 7.4.2.3).

# 15 Interfacing an application that is out of scope of ISO 26262

# 15.1 Objectives

This clause applies to T&B, where the objective is to achieve confidence that an application that is out of scope of ISO 26262 is not able to violate the safety goals of the base vehicle or item that has been developed in accordance with the ISO 26262 series of standards.

# 15.2 General

The application of this clause is intended for commercial vehicle business models where a company assembles or integrates a complete vehicle that is not in scope of ISO 26262 but to which another standard applies. The relationship between the application and item according to ISO 26262 is depicted in Figure 5.

Figure 5 — Item developed according to ISO 26262 used in scope of another standard

# EXAMPLE 1

A body builder, as an integrator, assembles a complete vehicle by integrating a base vehicle developed according to the ISO 26262 series of standards with body builder equipment developed according to the Machinery Directive.

# EXAMPLE 2

# 15.4 Requirements and recommendations

# 15.4.1

The requirements in 15.4 shall be applied to T&B.

# 15.4.2

The base vehicle manufacturer or supplier of an item or element shall communicate information to the integrator identifying the modifiable systems and components and the permitted system safety limits/requirements of the modifications.

# 15.4.3

The base vehicle manufacturer or supplier of an item shall communicate the safety measures required to be applied by the integrator.

# NOTE 1

It is assumed that the integrator has the necessary capability to realize the safety measures.

# EXAMPLE 1

Criteria for the capability of an integrator can be:

46 © ISO 2018 – All rights reserved
---
# ISO 26262-8:2018(E)

- compliance with other safety standards,
- an appropriate safety culture, and
- an established quality management system.

NOTE 2 The base vehicle manufacturer or supplier of an item or element makes assumptions about intended integrator use cases together with the safety requirements. For exceptions, the integrator contacts the base vehicle manufacturer or supplier of the item or element for safety requirements.

EXAMPLE 2 A body builder contacts a base vehicle manufacturer to request PTO activation during driving. The body builder uses ISO 13849 and both agree on an ASIL to ISO 13849. The base vehicle manufacturer communicates the safety requirements (with ASIL) regarding the PTO request, the body builder complies with these requirements (with agreed Performance Level). The base vehicle manufacturer enables the requested PTO function for the body builder.

# 16 Integration of safety-related systems not developed according to ISO 26262

# 16.1 Objectives

This clause applies to T&B, where the objective is to achieve confidence that a system or component that is not developed according the ISO 26262 series of standards satisfies the required level of functional safety needed for the integration into an item developed according to the ISO 26262 series of standards.

# 16.2 General

The application of this clause is intended for commercial vehicle business models where a company which follows ISO 26262 integrates a system or component which is not developed according to the ISO 26262 series of standards, but which has been developed according to another standard. The relationship between the application and item according to the ISO 26262 series of standards is depicted in Figure 6.

NOTE 1 Since this business model can demand higher effort and development costs for the integrator due to additional safety activities, a conventional ISO 26262 development is favoured.

NOTE 2 A business model for commercial vehicles could be series production with low quantities.

NOTE 3 Another standard could be the Machinery Directive including IEC 61508, ISO 13849 and ISO 25119. Company specific processes could also be used for the integration.

| 12     | The objective of the qualification of software components is to provide evidence for their suitability for re-use in items developed in compliance with the ISO 26262 series of standards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Organization-specific rules and processes for functional safety in accordance with ISO 26262-2:2018, 5.5.1 | 12.5.1 Software component documentation resulting from requirement 12.4.2.1. 12.5.2 Software component qualification report resulting from requirement 12.4.2.2 to 12.4.2.5. 12.5.3 Software component qualification verification report resulting from requirement 12.4.3.                                     |
| 13     | The objective of this Clause is to ensure that the functional behaviour is adequate to meet the allocated safety requirements and therefore the risk of a violation of a safety goal or of a safety requirement due to a systematic fault of the hardware element is sufficiently low. Suitability for use based on random fault management is established by the integrator of the evaluated hardware element, at the next highest level of design integration. | Organization-specific rules and processes for functional safety in accordance with ISO 26262-2:2018, 5.5.1 | 13.5.1 Hardware element evaluation plan resulting from requirement 13.4.3.2. 13.5.2 Hardware element test plan if applicable, resulting from requirement 13.4.3.5.1. 13.5.3 Hardware element evaluation report for hardware elements resulting from requirement 13.4.1.1, 13.4.3.6 and 13.4.4.3, if applicable. |

In this Clause, the use of the term “hardware element” refers either to COTS hardware components or parts, or to custom hardware components or parts, that are not originally developed or designed according to the ISO 26262 series of standard and are considered to be safety-related within the context of the ISO 26262 compliant item or element in which they are to be integrated.

More precisely the evaluation of hardware elements is an alternative means of compliance with ISO 26262-5. The hardware elements eligible for evaluation can either be specific to an application or standard elements. Such elements are often developed for use across many industries either for automotive application or non-automotive application.

# ISO 26262-8:2018(E)

# Annex B

# (informative)

# Development Interface Agreement (DIA) example

# B.1 Purpose

This annex provides an illustrative example of a DIA, in accordance with the requirements of Clause 5 [especially 5.4.3.1 c) to k)], with organization-specific adaptation under the requirements and recommendations of ISO 26262-2:2018, 5.4.6 and ISO 26262-2:2018, 5.5.1, if any. Project specific tailoring, in accordance with ISO 26262-2:2018, 6.4.5, can also be applied.

# B.2 General

Many factors will affect the type and amount of customer-supplier interactions; the example is simplified, based on an application scenario described in B.3 and a set of premises listed in B.4. Tables B.1 to B.3 constitute an example of a DIA as follows:

- Table B.1 approximately corresponds to the requirements of 5.4.2, with some organization-specific additions, intended to avoid or eliminate risk from a supplier with inadequate capability.
- Table B.2 approximately corresponds to the requirements of 5.4.3, with some organization-specific additions, intended to avoid or eliminate risk from improper understanding or definition of the boundary of Component C and its interactions with its environment.
- Table B.3 approximately corresponds to the requirements of 5.4.4, as applied to hardware Component C.

NOTE In each table, the corresponding ISO 26262 clause is indicated in parentheses.

# B.3 Application scenario

The DIA example shown in Tables B.1 to B.3 is based on the following application scenario:

1. The customer is responsible for engineering and manufacturing the vehicle.
2. The customer is responsible for engineering the system comprised of many hardware and software components of which one hardware component, C, is to be sourced from some supplier.
3. Component C will be allocated requirements with assigned ASIL D.
4. Component C has not been developed previously, i.e., it is not a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product. It involves new technology for which there is an inadequate pool of proven suppliers.
5. Multiple suppliers are interested in the supply of Component C, but adequate capability to support the project is not evident.
6. A model-based development process is used.

# B.4   Premises

This example is developed on the following premises:

- a) Resources required for project management and engineering are available when needed.
- b) Assessment teams that qualify as “independent” are available to each participating organization, and are used where needed.
- c) The same process and architectural framework is in use in all the participating organizations, independently assessed to qualify for the highest integrity level.
- — Reusable assets conform to the process and architectural framework, and are independently assessed to qualify for the required integrity level.
- — Other resources, e.g., tools, conform to the process and architectural framework, and are independently assessed to qualify for the required integrity level.
- — The participating organizations choose specific processes and tools that are compatible, and commit to the same architecture.
- — Explicit meta-models or specifications define unambiguously the semantics of the tools, modelling languages, programming languages, and the produced models.
- — Models of externally-visible behaviour, performance (including worst-case), and failure modes and effects are available for hardware components, including I/O devices. The models are in a form that can be correctly integrated to create (sub-)system models.
- d) There is high quality execution of other customer-supplier interactions, not unique to high integrity engineering, not included in this example, e.g., interactions for business processes, project management, and quality management.

In case the premises above do not hold, additional customer-supplier interactions and effort will be required — not identified in this example.
