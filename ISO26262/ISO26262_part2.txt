# Introduction

The ISO 26262 series of standards is the adaptation of IEC 61508 series of standards to address the sector specific needs of electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems within road vehicles. This adaptation applies to all activities during the safety lifecycle of safety-related systems comprised of electrical, electronic and software components.

Safety is one of the key issues in the development of road vehicles. Development and integration of automotive functionalities strengthen the need for functional safety and the need to provide evidence that functional safety objectives are satisfied.

With the trend of increasing technological complexity, software content and mechatronic implementation, there are increasing risks from systematic failures and random hardware failures, these being considered within the scope of functional safety. ISO 26262 series of standards includes guidance to mitigate these risks by providing appropriate requirements and processes.

To achieve functional safety, the ISO 26262 series of standards:

- a) provides a reference for the automotive safety lifecycle and supports the tailoring of the activities to be performed during the lifecycle phases, i.e., development, production, operation, service and decommissioning;
- b) provides an automotive-specific risk-based approach to determine integrity levels [Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs)];
- c) uses ASILs to specify which of the requirements of ISO 26262 are applicable to avoid unreasonable residual risk;
- d) provides requirements for functional safety management, design, implementation, verification, validation and confirmation measures; and
- e) provides requirements for relations between customers and suppliers.

The ISO 26262 series of standards is concerned with functional safety of E/E systems that is achieved through safety measures including safety mechanisms. It also provides a framework within which safety-related systems based on other technologies (e.g. mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic) can be considered.

The achievement of functional safety is influenced by the development process (including such activities as requirements specification, design, implementation, integration, verification, validation and configuration), the production and service processes and the management processes.

Safety is intertwined with common function-oriented and quality-oriented activities and work products. The ISO 26262 series of standards addresses the safety-related aspects of these activities and work products.

Figure 1 shows the overall structure of the ISO 26262 series of standards. The ISO 26262 series of standards is based upon a V-model as a reference process model for the different phases of product development. Within the figure:

- — the shaded “V”s represent the interconnection among ISO 26262-3, ISO 26262-4, ISO 26262-5, ISO 26262-6 and ISO 26262-7;
- — for motorcycles:
- - — ISO 26262-12:2018, Clause 8 supports ISO 26262-3;
- — ISO 26262-12:2018, Clauses 9 and 10 support ISO 26262-4;

— the specific clauses are indicated in the following manner: “m-n”, where “m” represents the number of the particular part and “n” indicates the number of the clause within that part.

# Part 2: Management of functional safety

# 1 Scope

This document is intended to be applied to safety-related systems that include one or more electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems and that are installed in series production road vehicles, excluding mopeds. This document does not address unique E/E systems in special vehicles such as E/E systems designed for drivers with disabilities.

NOTE Other dedicated application-specific safety standards exist and can complement the ISO 26262 series of standards or vice versa.

Systems and their components released for production, or systems and their components already under development prior to the publication date of this document, are exempted from the scope of this edition. This document addresses alterations to existing systems and their components released for production prior to the publication of this document by tailoring the safety lifecycle depending on the alteration.

This document addresses integration of existing systems not developed according to this document and systems developed according to this document by tailoring the safety lifecycle.

This document addresses possible hazards caused by malfunctioning behaviour of safety-related E/E systems, including interaction of these systems. It does not address hazards related to electric shock, fire, smoke, heat, radiation, toxicity, flammability, reactivity, corrosion, release of energy and similar hazards, unless directly caused by malfunctioning behaviour of safety-related E/E systems.

This document describes a framework for functional safety to assist the development of safety-related E/E systems. This framework is intended to be used to integrate functional safety activities into a company-specific development framework. Some requirements have a clear technical focus to implement functional safety into a product; others address the development process and can therefore be seen as process requirements in order to demonstrate the capability of an organization with respect to functional safety.

This document does not address the nominal performance of E/E systems.

This document specifies the requirements for functional safety management for automotive applications, including the following:

- project-independent requirements with regard to the organizations involved (overall safety management), and
- project-specific requirements with regard to the management activities in the safety lifecycle, i.e. management during the concept phase and the product development phases (at the system, hardware and software level), and regarding production, operation, service and decommissioning.

Annex A provides an overview on objectives, prerequisites and work products of this document.

# 4 Requirements for compliance

# 4.1 Purpose

This clause describes how:

- a) to achieve compliance with the ISO 26262 series of standards;
- b) to interpret the tables used in the ISO 26262 series of standards; and
- c) to interpret the applicability of each clause, depending on the relevant ASIL(s).

# 4.2 General requirements

When claiming compliance with the ISO 26262 series of standards, each requirement shall be met, unless one of the following applies:

- a) tailoring of the safety activities in accordance with this document has been performed that shows that the requirement does not apply; or
- b) a rationale is available that the non-compliance is acceptable and the rationale has been evaluated in accordance with this document.

Informative content, including notes and examples, is only for guidance in understanding, or for clarification of the associated requirement, and shall not be interpreted as a requirement itself or as complete or exhaustive.

The results of safety activities are given as work products. “Prerequisites” are information which shall be available as work products of a previous phase. Given that certain requirements of a clause are ASIL-dependent or may be tailored, certain work products may not be needed as prerequisites.

“Further supporting information” is information that can be considered, but which in some cases is not required by the ISO 26262 series of standards as a work product of a previous phase and which may be

made available by external sources that are different from the persons or organizations responsible for the functional safety activities.

# 4.3 Interpretations of tables

Tables are normative or informative depending on their context. The different methods listed in a table contribute to the level of confidence in achieving compliance with the corresponding requirement. Each method in a table is either:

- a) a consecutive entry (marked by a sequence number in the leftmost column, e.g. 1, 2, 3), or
- b) an alternative entry (marked by a number followed by a letter in the leftmost column, e.g. 2a, 2b, 2c).

For consecutive entries, all listed highly recommended and recommended methods in accordance with the ASIL apply. It is allowed to substitute a highly recommended or recommended method by others not listed in the table, in this case, a rationale shall be given describing why these comply with the corresponding requirement. If a rationale can be given to comply with the corresponding requirement without choosing all entries, a further rationale for omitted methods is not necessary.

For alternative entries, an appropriate combination of methods shall be applied in accordance with the ASIL indicated, independent of whether they are listed in the table or not. If methods are listed with different degrees of recommendation for an ASIL, the methods with the higher recommendation should be preferred. A rationale shall be given that the selected combination of methods or even a selected single method complies with the corresponding requirement.

NOTE A rationale based on the methods listed in the table is sufficient. However, this does not imply a bias for or against methods not listed in the table.

For each method, the degree of recommendation to use the corresponding method depends on the ASIL and is categorized as follows:

- — “++” indicates that the method is highly recommended for the identified ASIL;
- — “+” indicates that the method is recommended for the identified ASIL; and
- — “o” indicates that the method has no recommendation for or against its usage for the identified ASIL.

# 4.4 ASIL-dependent requirements and recommendations

The requirements or recommendations of each sub-clause shall be met for ASIL A, B, C and D, if not stated otherwise. These requirements and recommendations refer to the ASIL of the safety goal.

If ASIL decomposition has been performed at an earlier stage of development, in accordance with ISO 26262-9:2018, Clause 5, the ASIL resulting from the decomposition shall be met.

If an ASIL is given in parentheses in the ISO 26262 series of standards, the corresponding sub-clause shall be considered as a recommendation rather than a requirement for this ASIL. This has no link with the parenthesis notation related to ASIL decomposition.

# 4.5 Adaptation for motorcycles

For items or elements of motorcycles for which requirements of ISO 26262-12 are applicable, the requirements of ISO 26262-12 supersede the corresponding requirements in this document. Requirements of this document that are superseded by ISO 26262-12 are defined in Part 12.

# 4.6 Adaptation for trucks, buses, trailers and semi-trailers

Content that is intended to be unique for trucks, buses, trailers and semi-trailers (T&amp;B) is indicated as such.

# 5 Overall safety management

# 5.1 Objectives

The intent of this clause is to ensure the organizations involved in the execution of the safety lifecycle, i.e. those that are responsible for the safety lifecycle or are performing safety activities in the safety lifecycle, achieve the following objectives:

- a) to institute and maintain a safety culture that supports and encourages the effective achievement of functional safety and promotes effective communication with other disciplines related to functional safety;
- b) to institute and maintain adequate organization-specific rules and processes for functional safety;
- c) to institute and maintain processes to ensure an adequate resolution of identified safety anomalies;
- d) to institute and maintain a competence management system to ensure that the competence of the involved persons is commensurate with their responsibilities; and
- e) to institute and maintain a quality management system to support functional safety.

This clause serves as a prerequisite to the activities in the ISO 26262 safety lifecycle.

# 5.2 General

# 5.2.1 Overview of the safety lifecycle

The ISO 26262 reference safety lifecycle encompasses the principal safety activities during the concept phase, product development, production, operation, service and decommissioning. Planning, coordinating and monitoring the progress of the safety activities, as well as the responsibility to ensure that the confirmation measures are performed, are key management tasks and are performed throughout the lifecycle. The safety lifecycle may be tailored (see Clause 6).

NOTE 1 The safety activities during the concept phase, the product development, production, operation, service and decommissioning are described in detail in ISO 26262-3, ISO 26262-4, ISO 26262-5, ISO 26262-6 and ISO 26262-7.

NOTE 2 Table A.1 provides an overview of the objectives, prerequisites and work products of the management of functional safety.

# 5.2.2 Explanatory remarks on the safety lifecycle

# 5.2.2.1 General

The ISO 26262 series of standards specifies requirements with regard to specific phases and sub-phases of the safety lifecycle, but also includes requirements that apply to several, or all, phases of the safety lifecycle, such as the requirements for the management of functional safety.

The key safety management tasks are to plan, coordinate and track the activities related to functional safety. These management tasks apply to all phases of the safety lifecycle. The requirements for the management of functional safety are given in this part, which distinguishes:

- overall safety management (see Clause 5);

© ISO 2018 – All rights reserved
---
# ISO 26262-2:2018(E)

— project dependent safety management, regarding the concept phase and the product development phases at the system, hardware and software level (see Clause 6); and

— safety management regarding production, operation, service and decommissioning (see Clause 7).

The planning of the safety activities regarding development is initiated at the concept phase and is refined as necessary through the product development phases (system, hardware and software) until the decision to release the item, or element, for production. The planning of the activities regarding production, operation, service, and decommissioning is initiated during the product development at the system level.

Sub-clause 5.2.2.2 explains the definitions of different phases and sub-phases of the safety lifecycle. Other key concepts to take into consideration during the safety lifecycle are explained in sub-clause 5.2.2.3.

# 5.2.2.2 Phases and sub-phases of the safety lifecycle

a) item definition (a sub-phase of the concept phase):

The initiating task of the safety lifecycle is to develop a description of the item with regard to its functionality, interfaces, environmental conditions, legal requirements, known hazards, etc. The boundary of the item and its interfaces, as well as assumptions concerning other items, elements, or external measures are determined (see ISO 26262-3:2018, Clause 5).

b) hazard analysis and risk assessment (a sub-phase of the concept phase):

The hazard analysis and risk assessment is performed as given in ISO26262-3:2018, Clause 6. First, the hazard analysis and risk assessment estimates the probability of exposure, the controllability and the severity of the hazardous events with regard to the item. Together, these parameters determine the ASILs of the hazardous events. Subsequently, the hazard analysis and risk assessment determines the safety goals for the item, with the safety goals being the top level safety requirements for the item. The ASILs determined for the hazardous events are assigned to the corresponding safety goals. The assumptions regarding human behaviour, including controllability and human response, in the hazard analysis and risk assessment, the functional safety concept and the technical safety concept, as well as the technical assumptions relevant for the ASIL classification are validated (see ISO 26262-3:2018, Clause 6, ISO 26262-3:2018, Clause 7 and ISO 26262-4:2018, Clause 8).

During the subsequent phases and sub-phases, detailed safety requirements are derived from the safety goals. A safety requirement inherits the ASIL of the corresponding safety goal, or receives the ASIL after decomposition in the case requirements decomposition with respect to ASIL tailoring has been applied (see ISO 26262-9:2018, Clause 5).

c) functional safety concept (a sub-phase of the concept phase):

Based on the safety goals, a functional safety concept (see ISO 26262-3:2018, Clause 7) is developed considering the preliminary architectural assumptions. The functional safety concept is developed by deriving functional safety requirements from the safety goals and by allocating these functional safety requirements to the elements of the item. The functional safety concept may also include other technologies or rely on external measures (see ISO 26262-3:2018, Clause 7). In those cases, the corresponding assumptions or expected behaviours are validated (see ISO 26262-4:2018, Clause 8). The implementation of other technologies is outside the scope of the ISO 26262 series of standards and the implementation of the external measures is outside the scope of the item development.

d) product development at the system level

After the functional safety concept is specified, the item is developed at the system level, as given in ISO 26262-4. The system development process is based on the concept of a V-model with the specification of the technical safety requirements, the system architecture, the system design and

---
# ISO 26262-2:2018(E)

implementation on the left side and the integration, verification and the safety validation on the right side.

The hardware-software interface is specified in this phase. The interfaces between hardware and software are updated during the hardware and software development.

ISO 26262-4:2018, Figure 2 provides an overview of the sub-phases of the system development. The system development incorporates safety validation tasks for activities occurring within other safety lifecycle phases, including:

- the technical assumptions relevant for the ASIL classification;
- the validation of the assumptions concerning human behaviour, including controllability and human response;
- the validation of the aspects of the functional safety concept that are implemented by other technologies; and
- the validation of the assumptions concerning the effectiveness and the performance of external measures.

# e) product development at the hardware level

Based on the system design specification, the hardware is developed (see ISO 26262-5). The hardware development process is based on the concept of a V-model with the specification of the hardware requirements and the hardware design and implementation on the left side and the hardware integration and verification on the right side.

ISO 26262-5:2018, Figure 2 provides an overview of the sub-phases of the hardware development.

# f) product development at the software level

Based on the system design specification, the software is developed (see ISO 26262-6). The software development process is based on the concept of a V-model with the specification of the software requirements and the software architectural design and implementation on the left side, and the software integration and the verification on the right side.

ISO 26262-6:2018, Figure 2 provides an overview of the sub-phases of the software development.

# g) production, operation, service and decommissioning

The planning of this phase (see ISO 26262-7:2018, Clause 5), and the specification of the associated requirements, starts during the product development at the system level (see ISO 26262-4) and takes place in parallel with the system, hardware and software development. Such planning can be enabled by exchanging information or requirements e.g. safety-related special characteristics or requirements that improve the ability to produce the product.

This phase addresses the processes, means and instructions to ensure functional safety regarding production, operation, service and decommissioning of the item or element. The safety-related special characteristics and the development and management of instructions for the production, operation, service (maintenance and repair) and decommissioning of the item or element (see ISO 26262-7:2018, Clauses 6 and 7) are considered.

# 5.2.2.3 Other key concepts

# a) Confirmation measures

© ISO 2018 – All rights reserved
---
# ISO 26262-2:2018(E)

The confirmation measures (see Clause 6) are performed to judge the functional safety achieved by the item, or the contribution to the achievement of functional safety e.g. concerning the development of elements.

# b) Controllability

In the hazard analysis and risk assessment (see ISO 26262-3:2018, Clause 6), credit can be taken for the ability of the driver, or the other persons at risk (e.g. pedestrians, cyclists, passengers, drivers of other vehicles) to avoid the specified harm, possibly supported by external measures. The assumptions regarding the controllability in the hazard analysis and risk assessment and the functional and technical safety concept are validated (see ISO 26262-3:2018, Clauses 6 and 7 and ISO 26262-4:2018, Clause 8).

NOTE The exposure and the severity depend on the scenario. The eventual controllability through human intervention is influenced by the design of the item and is therefore evaluated during the safety validation (see ISO 26262-4:2018, Clause 8).

# c) External measures

The external measures refer to the measures outside the boundary of the item (see ISO 26262-3:2018, Clause 5) that reduce or mitigate the potential hazards resulting from malfunctioning behaviour of the item. External measures can include additional in-vehicle devices such as dynamic stability controllers or run-flat tyres, but also devices external to the vehicle, such as crash barriers or tunnel fire-fighting systems.

The assumptions regarding the external measures in the item definition, the hazard analysis and risk assessment and the functional and technical safety concept are validated (see ISO 26262-4:2018, Clause 8).

External measures can be considered in the hazard analysis and risk assessment (see ISO 26262-3:2018, Clause 6). However, if credit is taken from an external measure in the hazard analysis and risk assessment e.g. to reduce the ASIL of a safety goal, that external measure cannot be considered again as a risk reduction in the functional safety concept.

An external measure can be outside the scope of the ISO 26262 series of standards (e.g. if the external measure is realized by another technology or is implemented external to the vehicle), or in the scope of the ISO 26262 series of standards (e.g. if the external measure is realized by an E/E system distinct from the item).

# d) Impact analysis at the item level

An impact analysis (see 6.4.3) is performed at the item level to determine whether the item is a new development, a modification of an existing item, or an existing item with a modified environment. If there are one or more modifications, the implications of the modifications on functional safety are analysed.

# e) Impact analysis at the element level

An impact analysis is performed at the element level when an existing element is reused (see 6.4.4), so as to evaluate whether the reused element is able to comply with the safety requirements allocated to that element, considering the operational context in which the element is reused.

# f) Other technologies

Other technologies (e.g. mechanical and hydraulic technologies) are those different from electrical and electronic technologies. These can be considered in the specification and allocation of safety requirements (see ISO 26262-3:2018, Clause 7 and ISO 26262-4), or as an external measure. In other words, an element realized by another technology may be implemented within the item, or may be specified as an external measure.

# g) Release for production

---
# ISO 26262-2:2018(E)

The release for production (see 6.4.13) formalizes the decision to release the item, or element, for production, considering the results of the safety lifecycle, including the results of the applicable confirmation measures.

# ISO 26262-2:2018(E)

g) to plan the distributed developments (see ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 5);

h) to ensure a correct progression of the safety activities throughout the safety lifecycle;

i) to create a comprehensible safety case in order to provide the argument for the achievement of functional safety;

j) to judge whether the item achieves functional safety (i.e. the functional safety assessment), or to judge the contribution to the achievement of functional safety concerning an element (i.e. the functional safety assessment activities performed by a supplier) or work product (e.g. a confirmation review); and

k) to decide at the end of development whether the item, or element(s), can be released for production based on the evidence that supports confidence in the achieved functional safety.

# 6.2 General

In a project, the roles and responsibilities regarding the safety activities are defined and assigned. An impact analysis at the item level is performed to identify whether the item is a new item, a modification of an existing item, or an existing item with a modified environment. In the case of a modification, the implications on functional safety are analysed.

An impact analysis at the element level is performed in the case an existing element is reused, considering the operational context in which the element is reused.

Safety management includes the responsibility to plan and coordinate the safety activities, to track the progress of the safety activities against the corresponding planning and to describe and justify the tailored safety activities.

The safety planning is documented and references the development interface agreements (see ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 5) that define the interfaces with the safety plans of the other parties in a distributed development.

Safety management also includes the responsibility to ensure that the confirmation measures are performed. Depending on the applicable ASIL, confirmation measures are performed with sufficient independence regarding resources, management and release authority.

Confirmation measures include confirmation reviews, a functional safety audit and a functional safety assessment:

- confirmation reviews are intended to judge whether the key work products (see Table 1) provide sufficient and convincing evidence of their contribution to the achievement of functional safety;
- if applicable, a functional safety audit evaluates the implementation of the processes required for the safety activities; and
- if applicable, a functional safety assessment judges whether the item achieves functional safety, or judges the contribution to the achievement of functional safety e.g. concerning the development of elements.

Table 1 lists the confirmation measures.

In addition to the confirmation measures, verification activities are performed. These verification activities, which correspond to requirements of other parts of the ISO 26262 series of standards, are intended to verify that the associated work products fulfil the project requirements and the technical requirements, especially with respect to use cases and failure modes.

Finally, the person responsible for the release of the item, or elements of the item, decides whether the item, or element(s), is ready for series-production and operation, based on the evidence that supports confidence in the achieved functional safety.

# 6.4.4 Reuse of an existing element

In the case an existing element is reused, an impact analysis at the element level shall be performed, which shall:

1. identify the modifications to the operational context, including resulting modifications of the element;
2. evaluate whether the reused element, with or without modifications, is able to comply with the allocated safety requirements that result from the item, or element, into which the considered element is to be integrated;
3. NOTE 1 Existing elements can be reused with, or without, modifications being planned for that element. Modifications of the element can be planned, for example, to enable the integration of the existing element.

identify the safety activities to be performed based on an evaluation of the implications of the modifications, including implications on the validity of previously made assumptions; and
4. evaluate whether the existing safety-related documentation regarding the reused element is sufficient to support the integration of the element into the item, or element, in which the considered element is to be integrated.

NOTE 2 The impact analysis considered in this clause concerns modifications to the operational context of the element that are considered in the planning phase. Design modifications considered during the execution of the development are implemented through a change management process (see ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 8).

NOTE 3 An existing element can be reused:

1. based on an evaluation of hardware elements (see ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 13),
2. based on a qualification of software components (see ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 12),
3. based on a proven in use argument (see ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 14), or
4. as a Safety Element out of Context (see ISO 26262-10).

# 6.4.5 Tailoring of the safety activities

# 6.4.5.1

A safety activity with regard to a specific item development may be tailored, i.e. omitted or performed in a different manner than prescribed in the reference ISO 26262 lifecycle. If such a safety activity is tailored, then

1. the tailoring shall be defined in the safety plan (see 6.4.6.5, b); and
2. a rationale as to why the tailoring is appropriate and sufficient to achieve functional safety shall be available.

NOTE 1 The rationale considers the ASILs of the corresponding requirements.

NOTE 2 The rationale for the tailoring is included in the safety plan and reviewed during the confirmation review of the safety plan (see 6.4.9) or during the functional safety assessment (see 6.4.12).

NOTE 3 This requirement applies to tailoring for application on a specific item. With regard to tailoring of the safety lifecycle for application across item developments within an organization, only 5.4.6 applies.

# 6.4.5.2

If a safety activity is tailored in accordance with 6.4.5.1 as a result of an impact analysis in accordance with 6.4.3 or 6.4.4, then the tailoring shall comply with 6.4.6.7.

# 6.4.5.3

If a safety activity is tailored in accordance with 6.4.5.1 as a result of a proven in use argument, then the tailoring shall comply with ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 14.

# 6.4.5 Tailoring of safety activities

# 6.4.5.4

If a safety activity is tailored in accordance with 6.4.5.1 because of an evaluation of hardware elements, the tailoring shall comply with ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 13.

# 6.4.5.5

If a safety activity is tailored in accordance with 6.4.5.1 because of a qualification of software components, the tailoring shall comply with ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 12.

# 6.4.5.6

If a safety activity is tailored in accordance with 6.4.5.1 based on a rationale that considers the confidence in the usage of software tools, then the tailoring shall comply with ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 11.

# 6.4.5.7

If the safety activities are tailored in accordance with 6.4.5.1 because an element is developed as a Safety Element out of Context (“SEooC”), then

- a) the development of the safety element out of context shall be based on a requirement specification that is derived from assumptions on an intended use and context, including its external interfaces; and
- b) the assumptions on the intended use and context of the safety element out of context shall be validated when the element is integrated in its target application.

NOTE 1 The ISO 26262 series of standards as a whole cannot be applied to an element developed as a safety element out of context because functional safety is not an element property (however, an element of an item can be identified as safety related). Functional safety is an item property that can be evaluated by means of a functional safety assessment.

EXAMPLE A microcontroller developed as a safety element out of context

NOTE 2 See ISO 26262-10 for further details of a Safety Element out of Context development.

# 6.4.5.8

This requirement applies to item developments for T&B: if an application that is out of scope of the ISO 26262 series of standards is being interfaced with a base vehicle or item that has been developed in accordance with those standards, then tailoring of corresponding safety activities shall be performed in accordance with ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 15.

# 6.4.5.9

This requirement applies to item developments for T&B: if safety activities are performed to achieve confidence that a system or component not developed according to the ISO 26262 series of standards satisfies the required level of functional safety needed for the integration into an item developed in accordance with those standards, then tailoring of these safety activities shall be performed in accordance with ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 16.

# 6.4.6 Planning and coordination of the safety activities

# 6.4.6.1

The safety manager shall be responsible for the planning and coordination of the safety activities in which the organization is involved, in accordance with 5.4.2.7.

NOTE 1 The safety manager can delegate tasks to persons that possess the required skills, competences and qualifications (see 5.4.4).

NOTE 2 Depending on whether the item is a new development, a modification of an existing item or an existing item with a modified environment (see 6.4.3), or whether the element is new or reused (see 6.4.4), the extent of the safety activities can vary, and the activities are planned accordingly.

# 6.4.6.2

The safety manager shall be responsible for maintaining the safety plan, and for monitoring the progress of the safety activities against the safety plan.

# 6.4.6.3

The responsibilities with regard to performing the safety activities shall be clearly assigned and communicated within the organization in accordance with 5.4.2.7 and 5.4.4.

The work products required by the safety plan shall be subject to configuration management, change management and documentation, in accordance with ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 7, 8 and 10, respectively, no later than the time of entering the phase “product development at the system level” (see ISO 26262-4).

# 6.4.8 Safety case

# 6.4.8.1

A safety case shall be developed, in accordance with the safety plan, in order to provide the argument for the achievement of functional safety.

# 6.4.8.2

The safety case should progressively compile the work products that are generated during the safety lifecycle to support the safety argument.

NOTE 1 In the case of a distributed development, the safety case of the item can be a combination of the safety cases of the customer and of the suppliers, which references evidence from the work products generated by the respective parties. Then the overall argument of the item is supported by arguments from all parties. The interfaces between the customer and a supplier are defined in a Development Interface Agreement (see ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 5).

NOTE 2 To support safety planning according to 6.4.6, the intended safety arguments can be identified prior to work products becoming available. To support progressive functional safety assessments according to 6.4.12.3 the safety case can be released progressively as work products are generated to provide evidence for the safety arguments.

# 6.4.9 Confirmation measures

# 6.4.9.1

The functional safety of the item and its elements shall be confirmed, based on:

1. confirmation reviews to judge whether the key work products, i.e. those included in Table 1, provide sufficient and convincing evidence of their contribution to the achievement of functional safety, considering the corresponding objectives and requirements of the ISO 26262 series of standards, in accordance with Table 1 and 6.4.10;

NOTE 1 The confirmation reviews are performed for those work products that are specified in Table 1 and required by the safety plan.
2. a functional safety audit to judge the implementation of the processes required for functional safety, in accordance with Table 1 and 6.4.11; and

NOTE 2 The reference processes required for functional safety are defined in the ISO 26262 series of standards. The processes pertaining to an item or element are defined through the activities referenced or specified in the safety plan.
3. a functional safety assessment to judge the achieved functional safety of the item, or the contribution to the achievement of functional safety by the developed elements, in accordance with Table 1 and 6.4.12.

NOTE 3 The aim of the independence defined in Table 1 is to ensure an objective, unbiased viewpoint and to avoid conflict of interest. The use of the term “independence” in this document relates to organizational independence.

NOTE 4 Guidance for the confirmation measure is given in Annex C.

NOTE 5 A report that is a result of a confirmation measure includes the name and revision number of the work products or process documents analysed (see ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 10).

NOTE 6 If the item changes subsequent to the completion of confirmation measures, then the pertinent confirmation measures will be repeated or supplemented (see ISO 26262-8:2018, 8.4.5.2).

NOTE 7 Confirmation measures such as confirmation reviews and functional safety audits can be merged and combined with the functional safety assessment to support the handling of comparable variants of an item.

# ISO 26262-2:2018(E)

# 6.4.12.7

The scope of a functional safety assessment shall include:

1. the safety plan and all the work products required by the safety plan;

NOTE 1 The functional safety assessor can tailor the level of detail with which a particular work product is reviewed. However, those work products required by the safety plan which are listed in Table 1 merit particular attention.

NOTE 2 The functional safety assessor considers if requirements management (see ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 6), including bidirectional traceability, is adequately implemented.

NOTE 3 The examination of the corresponding work products supports the judgement of whether an ISO 26262 objective is achieved (see 6.4.12.2).
2. the processes required for functional safety;

NOTE 4 The evaluation of the implemented processes can be based on the results of the functional safety audit and, if any, the resulting corrective actions.
3. the appropriateness and effectiveness of the performed or implemented safety measures that can be assessed during the development of the item or element;

NOTE 5 The functional safety assessment checks the suitability of the requirements related to production, operation, service and decommissioning. Regarding production, the correct implementation of such requirements is checked during the analysis of the production process capability (see ISO 26262-7:2018, 5.4.2.2 and ISO 26262-7:2018, 6.4.1.3).
4. the arguments, if provided, as to why functional safety is achieved considering the achievement of the relevant objectives of the ISO 26262 series of standards;

NOTE 6 The person(s) responsible for the creation of a work product can provide an argument as to why the corresponding objectives of the ISO 26262 series of standards are achieved in order to facilitate a functional safety assessment, considering 6.4.12.2.

NOTE 7 Compliance with all the corresponding ISO 26262 requirements is a sufficient rationale for having achieved an ISO 26262 objective.
5. the argument provided in the safety case; and
6. the rationales for the safety anomalies managed to closure in accordance with 5.4.3.

NOTE 8 In the case of a distributed development, functional safety assessment activities are performed at the customer and at its suppliers (see ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 5). A functional safety assessment at a supplier judges whether the customer’s safety requirements are complied with and judges the contribution to the achievement of functional safety by the developed elements or work products. The supplier provides functional safety assessment reports to the customer at the milestones and in the form defined in the development interface agreement (see ISO 26262-8:2018, 5.4.5). The functional safety assessment at a customer considers the suppliers' safety assessment reports (see 6.4.12.8). Finally, if the customer is a vehicle manufacturer, the functional safety assessment includes a judgement of the achieved functional safety of the item integrated in the target vehicle.

# 6.4.12.8

A functional safety assessment shall consider:

1. the planning of the other confirmation measures [see 6.4.6.5 f)];
2. the results from the confirmation reviews and functional safety audit;
3. the recommendations resulting from the previous functional safety assessment and the resulting corrective actions, if applicable (see 6.4.12.9 to 6.4.12.13 and ISO 26262-8:2018, 8.4.5.2); and
4. the results of the functional safety assessment activities regarding the elements or work products developed by suppliers, corresponding with the Development Interface Agreements in accordance with ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 5, if applicable.

# Safety culture

Safety culture includes:

1. personal dedication and integrity of the persons responsible for achieving or maintaining functional safety and of the persons performing or supporting safety activities in the organization; and
2. safety thinking throughout the organization that allows for a questioning attitude, that prevents complacency, commits to excellence, fosters the taking of responsibility and corporate self-regulation in safety matters.

# Annex E

# (informative)

# Guidance on potential interaction of functional safety with cybersecurity

# E.1 Objectives

To address potential adverse effects of cybersecurity on the achievement of functional safety, this annex provides guidance on the possible interactions between the activities of functional safety and cybersecurity where both contribute to the overall achievement of safe E/E systems. The aim is to provide guidance from the perspective of functional safety and not to provide guidance on the achievement of cybersecurity. The relationship between development processes of functional safety and cybersecurity depends on the organization and the scope of the project, therefore the methods or the technical content of the interaction is not described. Organizations can determine the most appropriate approach for this interaction.

# E.2 General

While functional safety addresses systematic and random faults resulting in malfunctioning behaviour of E/E systems, cybersecurity addresses issues resulting from malicious intent external to the E/E system. To achieve functional safety it can be advantageous to know relevant information from cybersecurity that can negatively impact functional safety or that can support the achievement of functional safety.

NOTE Refer also to SAE J3061, ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 15408.

# E.3 Potential interaction between functional safety and cybersecurity

# E.3.1 Functional safety management

Functional safety management interaction with the management of cybersecurity can include:

- plans and milestones for cybersecurity activities in order to consider dependencies that can influence the planning of the safety activities, for example, for the development of software, the selection of tools, programming languages and guidelines;
- coordination of the management of field monitoring activities for cybersecurity and functional safety including incident reporting, tracking and resolution in order to enable the communication of safety-related cybersecurity field incidents to functional safety.

# E.3.2 Concept phase

In the concept phase, the interaction can include:

- cybersecurity threats to be analysed as a hazard from a functional safety perspective in order to support the completeness of the hazard analyses and risk assessment and the safety goals;
- functional safety can provide information such as hazards and associated risks to support the cybersecurity identification of threats;

# ISO 26262-2:2018(E)

# E.3.3 Product development

In product development, the interaction can include:

- technical information related to the design and implementation of the cybersecurity strategies or countermeasures for the E/E-system in order to determine potential impacts on the technical safety concept and the system design;
- cybersecurity software and hardware design considerations in order to determine potential impacts on the achievement of the software and hardware safety requirements and design constraints such as independence;
- functional safety can provide information related to design and implementation of safety measures in order to communicate functional safety constraints that can be relevant to cybersecurity;
- safety and cybersecurity analysis activities can be harmonized in order to uncover potential cybersecurity impacts on functional safety. Safety analyses can also consider the impact of cybersecurity strategies and countermeasures;
- cybersecurity countermeasures identified to address systematic failures in order to determine the potential impacts on functional safety, for example, methods required for the development of safety measures that are shared with cybersecurity.

# E.3.4 Production and operation

During production and operation the interaction can include:

- cybersecurity incident resolution strategies in order to consider potential impacts on functional safety due to design changes resulting from cybersecurity incident response.
