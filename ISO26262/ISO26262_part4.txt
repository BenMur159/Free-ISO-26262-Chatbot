# Introduction

The ISO 26262 series of standards is the adaptation of IEC 61508 series of standards to address the sector specific needs of electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems within road vehicles. This adaptation applies to all activities during the safety lifecycle of safety-related systems comprised of electrical, electronic and software components.

Safety is one of the key issues in the development of road vehicles. Development and integration of automotive functionalities strengthen the need for functional safety and the need to provide evidence that functional safety objectives are satisfied.

With the trend of increasing technological complexity, software content and mechatronic implementation, there are increasing risks from systematic failures and random hardware failures, these being considered within the scope of functional safety. ISO 26262 series of standards includes guidance to mitigate these risks by providing appropriate requirements and processes.

To achieve functional safety, the ISO 26262 series of standards:

- a) provides a reference for the automotive safety lifecycle and supports the tailoring of the activities to be performed during the lifecycle phases, i.e., development, production, operation, service and decommissioning;
- b) provides an automotive-specific risk-based approach to determine integrity levels [Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs)];
- c) uses ASILs to specify which of the requirements of ISO 26262 are applicable to avoid unreasonable residual risk;
- d) provides requirements for functional safety management, design, implementation, verification, validation and confirmation measures; and
- e) provides requirements for relations between customers and suppliers.

The ISO 26262 series of standards is concerned with functional safety of E/E systems that is achieved through safety measures including safety mechanisms. It also provides a framework within which safety-related systems based on other technologies (e.g. mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic) can be considered.

The achievement of functional safety is influenced by the development process (including such activities as requirements specification, design, implementation, integration, verification, validation and configuration), the production and service processes and the management processes.

Safety is intertwined with common function-oriented and quality-oriented activities and work products. The ISO 26262 series of standards addresses the safety-related aspects of these activities and work products.

Figure 1 shows the overall structure of the ISO 26262 series of standards. The ISO 26262 series of standards is based upon a V-model as a reference process model for the different phases of product development. Within the figure:

- — the shaded “V”s represent the interconnection among ISO 26262-3, ISO 26262-4, ISO 26262-5, ISO 26262-6 and ISO 26262-7;
- — for motorcycles:
- - — ISO 26262-12:2018, Clause 8 supports ISO 26262-3;
- — ISO 26262-12:2018, Clauses 9 and 10 support ISO 26262-4;

— the specific clauses are indicated in the following manner: “m-n”, where “m” represents the number of the particular part and “n” indicates the number of the clause within that part.

# Part 4: Product development at the system level

# 1 Scope

This document is intended to be applied to safety-related systems that include one or more electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems and that are installed in series production road vehicles, excluding mopeds. This document does not address unique E/E systems in special vehicles such as E/E systems designed for drivers with disabilities.

NOTE Other dedicated application-specific safety standards exist and can complement the ISO 26262 series of standards or vice versa.

Systems and their components released for production, or systems and their components already under development prior to the publication date of this document, are exempted from the scope of this edition. This document addresses alterations to existing systems and their components released for production prior to the publication of this document by tailoring the safety lifecycle depending on the alteration.

This document addresses integration of existing systems not developed according to this document and systems developed according to this document by tailoring the safety lifecycle. This document addresses possible hazards caused by malfunctioning behaviour of safety-related E/E systems, including interaction of these systems. It does not address hazards related to electric shock, fire, smoke, heat, radiation, toxicity, flammability, reactivity, corrosion, release of energy and similar hazards, unless directly caused by malfunctioning behaviour of safety-related E/E systems.

This document describes a framework for functional safety to assist the development of safety-related E/E systems. This framework is intended to be used to integrate functional safety activities into a company-specific development framework. Some requirements have a clear technical focus to implement functional safety into a product; others address the development process and can therefore be seen as process requirements in order to demonstrate the capability of an organization with respect to functional safety.

This document does not address the nominal performance of E/E systems.

This document specifies the requirements for product development at the system level for automotive applications, including the following:

- general topics for the initiation of product development at the system level;
- specification of the technical safety requirements;
- the technical safety concept;
- system architectural design;
- item integration and testing; and
- safety validation.

Annex A provides an overview on objectives, prerequisites and work products of this document.

# 4 Requirements for compliance

# 4.1 Purpose

This clause describes how:

- a) to achieve compliance with the ISO 26262 series of standards;
- b) to interpret the tables used in the ISO 26262 series of standards; and
- c) to interpret the applicability of each clause, depending on the relevant ASIL(s).

# 4.2 General requirements

When claiming compliance with the ISO 26262 series of standards, each requirement shall be met, unless one of the following applies:

- a) tailoring of the safety activities in accordance with ISO 26262-2 has been performed that shows that the requirement does not apply; or
- b) a rationale is available that the non-compliance is acceptable and the rationale has been evaluated in accordance with ISO 26262-2.

# ISO 26262-4:2018(E)

Informative content, including notes and examples, is only for guidance in understanding, or for clarification of the associated requirement, and shall not be interpreted as a requirement itself or as complete or exhaustive.

The results of safety activities are given as work products. “Prerequisites” are information which shall be available as work products of a previous phase. Given that certain requirements of a clause are ASIL-dependent or may be tailored, certain work products may not be needed as prerequisites.

“Further supporting information” is information that can be considered, but which in some cases is not required by the ISO 26262 series of standards as a work product of a previous phase and which may be made available by external sources that are different from the persons or organizations responsible for the functional safety activities.

# 4.3 Interpretations of tables

Tables are normative or informative depending on their context. The different methods listed in a table contribute to the level of confidence in achieving compliance with the corresponding requirement. Each method in a table is either:

- a) a consecutive entry (marked by a sequence number in the leftmost column, e.g. 1, 2, 3), or
- b) an alternative entry (marked by a number followed by a letter in the leftmost column, e.g. 2a, 2b, 2c).

For consecutive entries, all listed highly recommended and recommended methods in accordance with the ASIL apply. It is allowed to substitute a highly recommended or recommended method by others not listed in the table, in this case, a rationale shall be given describing why these comply with the corresponding requirement. If a rationale can be given to comply with the corresponding requirement without choosing all entries, a further rationale for omitted methods is not necessary.

For alternative entries, an appropriate combination of methods shall be applied in accordance with the ASIL indicated, independent of whether they are listed in the table or not. If methods are listed with different degrees of recommendation for an ASIL, the methods with the higher recommendation should be preferred. A rationale shall be given that the selected combination of methods or even a selected single method complies with the corresponding requirement.

NOTE A rationale based on the methods listed in the table is sufficient. However, this does not imply a bias for or against methods not listed in the table.

For each method, the degree of recommendation to use the corresponding method depends on the ASIL and is categorized as follows:

- “++” indicates that the method is highly recommended for the identified ASIL;
- “+” indicates that the method is recommended for the identified ASIL; and
- “o” indicates that the method has no recommendation for or against its usage for the identified ASIL.

# 4.4 ASIL-dependent requirements and recommendations

The requirements or recommendations of each sub-clause shall be met for ASIL A, B, C and D, if not stated otherwise. These requirements and recommendations refer to the ASIL of the safety goal.

If ASIL decomposition has been performed at an earlier stage of development, in accordance with ISO 26262-9:2018, Clause 5, the ASIL resulting from the decomposition shall be met.

If an ASIL is given in parentheses in the ISO 26262 series of standards, the corresponding sub-clause shall be considered as a recommendation rather than a requirement for this ASIL. This has no link with the parenthesis notation related to ASIL decomposition.

# 4.5 Adaptation for motorcycles

For items or elements of motorcycles for which requirements of ISO 26262-12 are applicable, the requirements of ISO 26262-12 supersede the corresponding requirements in this document. Requirements of ISO 26262-2 that are superseded by ISO 26262-12 are defined in Part 12.

# 4.6 Adaptation for trucks, buses, trailers and semi-trailers

Content that is intended to be unique for trucks, buses, trailers and semi-trailers (T&amp;B) is indicated as such.

# 5 General topics for the product development at the system level

# 5.1 Objectives

The objective of this clause is to provide an overview of product development at the system level.

# 5.2 General

The necessary activities during the development of a system are given in Figure 2. In an iterative process, the technical safety concept is developed, incorporating technical safety requirements and the system architectural design. The system architecture is established, the technical safety requirements are allocated to elements of the system, and, if applicable, on other technologies. In addition, the technical safety requirements are refined and requirements arising from the system architecture are added, including the hardware-software interface (HSI). Depending on the complexity of the architecture, the requirements for subsystems can be derived iteratively.

After their development, the hardware and software elements are integrated and tested to form an item that is then integrated into a vehicle. Once integrated at the vehicle level, safety validation is performed to provide evidence of functional safety with respect to the safety goals.

This document applies to the development of systems. ISO 26262-5 and ISO 26262-6 describe the development requirements for hardware and software, respectively.

# 6.2 General

The technical safety concept is an aggregation of the technical safety requirements and the corresponding system architectural design that provides rationale as to why the system architectural design is suitable to fulfil safety requirements resulting from activities described in ISO 26262-3 (with consideration of non-safety requirements) and design constraints.

The technical safety requirements specify the technical implementation of the functional safety requirements at their respective hierarchical level; considering both the item definition and the system architectural design, and addressing the detection of latent failures, fault avoidance, safety integrity and operation and service aspects.

The system architectural design is the selected system-level solution that is implemented by a technical system. The system architectural design aims to fulfil both, the allocated technical safety requirements and the non-safety requirements.

System development can be performed iteratively.

# 6.3 Inputs to this clause

# 6.3.1 Prerequisites

The following information shall be available:

- functional safety concept in accordance with ISO 26262-3:2018, 7.5.1;
- system architectural design (from an external source, see ISO 26262-3:2018, 7.3.1); and
- requirements to the item from other safety relevant items if applicable.

EXAMPLE Requirements from a park assist system to a brake system.

NOTE In a distributed development, a technical safety concept can be based on another technical safety concept realized by subsystems.

# 6.3.2 Further supporting information

The following information can be considered:

- hazard analysis and risk assessment report (see ISO 26262-3:2018, 6.5.1); and
- item definition (see ISO 26262-3:2018, 5.5.1).

# 6.4 Requirements and recommendations

# 6.4.1 Specification of the technical safety requirements

# 6.4.1.1

The technical safety requirements shall be specified in accordance with the functional safety concept and the system architectural design of the item considering the following:

1. the safety-related dependencies and constraints of items, systems and their elements;
2. the external interfaces of the system, if applicable; and
3. the configurability of the system.

NOTE 1 Design constraints can result from: environmental conditions, the installation space, the implementation itself (e.g. available performance, thermal capacity, thermal dissipation), and other functional or non-functional requirements (e.g. security, physical limits of used technology).
---
# ISO 26262-4:2018(E)

NOTE 2 The configurability of systems is determined by variants in the system elements, by configuration data or by calibration data and is often used as part of the strategy to reuse existing systems for different applications.

# 6.4.1.2

The technical safety requirements shall specify the stimulus response of the system that affects the achievement of safety requirements. This includes the combinations of relevant stimuli and failures with each relevant operating mode and defined system state.

EXAMPLE The Brake System Electronic Control Unit (ECU) disables Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) braking if a received ACC command message fails error detection code checks.

# 6.4.1.3

If other functions or requirements are implemented by the system or its elements, in addition to those functions for which technical safety requirements are specified, then these functions or requirements shall be specified or their specification referenced.

EXAMPLE Other requirements can come from Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) rules, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS), company platform strategies, functional concepts or other concepts such as cybersecurity concept.

# 6.4.1.4

Technical safety and non-safety requirements shall not contradict.

# 6.4.2 Safety mechanisms

# 6.4.2.1

The technical safety requirements shall specify the safety mechanisms that detect faults and prevent or mitigate failures present at the output of the system that violate the functional safety requirements (see ISO 26262-3:2018, Clause 7) including:

1. the safety mechanisms related to the detection, indication and control of faults in the system itself;

NOTE 1 This includes the system self-monitoring to detect random hardware faults and, if appropriate, to detect systematic faults.

NOTE 2 This includes safety mechanisms for the detection and control of communication channel failures (e.g. data interfaces, communication buses, wireless radio link).

NOTE 3 Safety mechanisms can be specified with respect to the appropriate level within the system architecture.
2. the safety mechanisms related to the detection, indication and control of faults in other external elements that interact with the system;

EXAMPLE External devices include other electronic control units, power supplies or communication devices.
3. the safety mechanisms that contribute to the system achieving or maintaining the safe state of the item;

NOTE 4 This includes arbitration in the case of multiple control requests from safety mechanisms.
4. the safety mechanisms to define and implement the warning and degradation strategy; and
5. the safety mechanisms that prevent faults from being latent.

NOTE 5 These safety mechanisms are usually related to self-tests that take place during power up (pre-drive checks), as in the case of measures a) to d), during operation, during power-down (post-drive checks), and as part of maintenance.

# 6.4.2.2

For each safety mechanism that enables an item to achieve or maintain a safe state, the following shall be specified:

1. the transition between states;

© ISO 2018 – All rights reserved
---
# ISO 26262-4:2018(E)

NOTE 1 This includes the requirements to control the actuators.

b) the fault handling time interval with respect to the timing requirements apportioned from the appropriate architectural level; and

NOTE 2 This sub-requirement aims to achieve a consistent timing within the boundary of the fault handling time interval) FTTI which is specified for each Safety Goal.

c) the emergency operation tolerance time interval, see ISO 26262-1:2018, 3.45, if the safe state of the item cannot be reached within the FTTI.

NOTE 3 In-vehicle testing and experimentation can be used to determine the emergency operation tolerance time interval.

EXAMPLE 1 Duration of the degraded operation prior to the safe state.

EXAMPLE 2 A safety mechanism for a brake-by-wire application, which depends on the power supply, can include the specification of a secondary power supply or storage device (capacity, time to activate and operate, etc.).

# 6.4.2.3

This requirement applies to ASILs (A), (B), C, and D. If applicable, safety mechanisms shall be specified to prevent faults from being latent.

NOTE 1 Only random hardware faults which are multiple-point faults have the potential to be latent.

EXAMPLE Self-tests are safety mechanisms which verify the status of components during the different operation modes (e.g. power-up, power-down, during operation or in an additional self-test mode) to detect multiple-point faults. Valve, relay or lamp function tests that take place during power up routines are examples of self-tests.

NOTE 2 Evaluation criteria identifying the need for safety mechanisms preventing faults from being latent are derived in accordance with good engineering practice. The latent fault metric, given in ISO 26262-5:2018, Clause 8, provides evaluation criteria.

# 6.4.2.4

This requirement applies to ASILs (A), (B), C, and D. To avoid multiple-point failures, the diagnostic test strategy shall be specified for each safety mechanism implemented to detect multiple-point faults, considering:

a) the reliability requirements of the hardware components with consideration given to their role in the architecture and their contribution to a multiple-point failure;

b) the specified quantitative target values for the maximum probability of violation of each safety goal due to random hardware failures (see ISO 26262-5:2018, Clause 9);

c) the assigned ASIL derived from the related safety goal, the related functional safety requirement or technical safety requirement at a higher hierarchical level; and

d) the multiple-point fault detection time interval.

NOTE 1 The diagnostic test strategy can be time driven (e.g. using the diagnostic test time interval) or event driven (e.g. a start-up test).

NOTE 2 A second-order multiple-point failure comprises two faults, separated by the multiple-point fault detection time interval.

NOTE 3 The use of the following measures depends on the time constraints:

- periodic testing of the system or elements during operation;
- self-tests of elements during power-up or power-down; and
- testing the system or elements during maintenance.

# ISO 26262-4:2018(E)

# 6.4.2.5

This requirement applies to ASILs (A), (B), C, and D. The development of safety mechanisms that are implemented only to prevent dual point faults from being latent shall at least comply with:

- a) ASIL B for technical safety requirements assigned ASIL D;
- b) ASIL A for technical safety requirements assigned ASIL B and ASIL C; and
- c) QM for technical safety requirements assigned ASIL A.

NOTE If ASIL decomposition is applied to a requirement, then this clause is applied to the decomposed requirement.

EXAMPLE A memory has a parity as its safety mechanism, with requirements rated ASIL B. The requirement for the self-test that tests the capability of the parity to detect and signal memory faults can be rated ASIL A.

# 6.4.3 System architectural design specification and technical safety concept

# 6.4.3.1

The system architectural design in this sub-phase and the technical safety concept shall be based on the item definition, functional safety concept and the prior system architectural design.

# 6.4.3.2

The consistency of the system architectural design in ISO 26262-3:2018, 7.3.1 and the system architectural design in this sub-phase shall be checked. If discrepancies are identified, an iteration of the activities described in ISO 26262-3:2018 may be necessary.

# 6.4.3.3

The system architectural design shall implement the technical safety requirements.

# 6.4.3.4

With regard to the implementation of the technical safety requirements, the following shall be considered in the system architectural design:

- a) the ability to verify the system architectural design;
- b) the technical capability of the intended hardware and software elements with regard to the achievement of functional safety; and
- c) the ability to execute tests during system integration.

# 6.4.3.5

The internal and external interfaces of safety-related elements shall be defined such that other elements shall not have adverse safety-related effects on the safety-related elements.

# 6.4.3.6

If ASIL decomposition is applied to the safety requirements during system architectural design, it shall be applied in accordance with ISO 26262-9:2018, Clause 5.

# 6.4.4 Safety Analyses and avoidance of systematic failures

# 6.4.4.1

Safety analyses on the system architectural design shall be performed in accordance with Table 1 and ISO 26262-9:2018, Clause 8 in order to:

- — provide evidence for the suitability of the system design to provide the specified safety-related functions and properties with respect to the ASIL;
- — identify the causes of failures and the effects of faults;
- — identify or confirm the safety-related system elements and interfaces; and
- — support the design specification and verify the effectiveness of the safety mechanisms based on identified causes of faults and the effects of failures.

# Table 1 — System architectural design analysis

| Methods              | A  | B  | ASIL C | D  |
| -------------------- | -- | -- | ------ | -- |
| 1 Deductive analysis | o  | +  | ++     | ++ |
| 2 Inductive analysis | ++ | ++ | ++     | ++ |

NOTE 1 Safety-related properties include independency and freedom from interference requirements.

NOTE 2 The purpose of these analyses is to assist in the design. Therefore at this stage, qualitative analysis is sufficient. Quantitative analysis can be performed if necessary.

NOTE 3 The analysis is conducted at the level of detail necessary to identify causes and effects of random hardware failures and systematic failures.

NOTE 4 The aim of using a combination of deductive and inductive methods is to provide complementary approaches to analysis, see also ISO 26262-9:2018, 8.2.

# 6.4.4.2

Identified internal causes of failure shall be eliminated, or their effects mitigated where necessary, to comply with the safety goals or requirements.

# 6.4.4.3

Identified external causes of failure shall be eliminated, or their effects mitigated where necessary, to comply with the safety goals or requirements.

# 6.4.4.4

To reduce the likelihood of systematic failures, well-trusted systems design principles should be applied where applicable. These may include the following:

- a) re-use of well-trusted technical safety concepts;
- b) re-use of well-trusted designs for elements, including hardware and software components;
- c) re-use of well-trusted mechanisms for the detection and control of failures; and
- d) re-use of well-trusted or standardized interfaces.

# 6.4.4.5

An analysis of the suitability of well-trusted design principles shall be performed and documented to ensure consistency and suitability to the product’s application.

# 6.4.4.6

In order to avoid systematic faults, the system architectural design shall exhibit the following properties:

- a) modularity;
- b) adequate level of granularity; and
- c) simplicity.

NOTE Aforementioned properties can be achieved by the use of design principles such as hierarchical design, precisely defined interfaces, avoidance of unnecessary complexity of components and interfaces, maintainability, and verifiability.

# 6.4.4.7

Hazards newly identified during safety analyses or during the system architectural design that are not already covered by a safety goal shall be included in an updated hazard analysis and risk assessment (HARA) in accordance with ISO 26262-3.

NOTE Hazards not already covered by a safety goal may be non-functional hazards. Non-functional hazards are outside the scope of ISO 26262, but they can be annotated in the hazard analysis and risk assessment; e.g. by annotating the hazard with the following statement “No ASIL is assigned to this hazard as it is not within the scope of ISO 26262”.

# ISO 26262-4:2018(E)

# 6.4.5 Measures for control of random hardware failures during operation

# 6.4.5.1

Measures for the detection, control or mitigation of random hardware failures shall be specified with respect to the system architectural design given in 6.4.3.

EXAMPLE 1 Such measures can be hardware diagnostic features and their usage by the software to detect random hardware failures.

EXAMPLE 2 A hardware design having random hardware failures that always result in the safe state being entered without detection (i.e. a fail-safe hardware design).

NOTE A quantitative approximation of the inductive and deductive analyses in 6.4.4.1 is helpful to decide if further safety measures are necessary. A final decision may be necessary after hardware analysis according to ISO 26262-5.

# 6.4.5.2

This requirement applies to ASILs (B), C, and D of the safety goal. One of the alternative procedures for the evaluation of violation of the safety goal due to random hardware failures (see ISO 26262-5:2018, Clause 9) shall be chosen and the target values shall be specified for final evaluation at the item level.

# 6.4.5.3

This requirement applies to ASILs (B), C, and D of the safety goal. Appropriate target values for failure rates and diagnostic coverage should be specified at the element level in order to comply with:

- a) the target values of the metrics in ISO 26262-5:2018, Clause 8; and
- b) the procedures in ISO 26262-5:2018, Clause 9.

# 6.4.5.4

This requirement applies to ASILs (B), C, and D. For distributed developments (see ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 5) the derived target values shall be communicated to each relevant party.

NOTE 1 Architectural constraints described in ISO 26262-5:2018, Clauses 8 and 9, are not necessarily applicable to COTS parts and components. This is because suppliers usually cannot foresee the usage of their products in the end-item and the potential safety implications. In such a case, basic data such as failure rate, failure modes, failure rate distribution per failure modes, built-in diagnostics, etc. are made available by the supplier in order to allow the estimation of architectural constraints at overall hardware architecture level.

# 6.4.6 Allocation to hardware and software

# 6.4.6.1

The technical safety requirements shall be allocated to the system architectural design elements with system, hardware or software as the implementing technology.

NOTE If the requirements are allocated to system as implementing technology, ISO 26262-4 is used again for further development of these requirements until they can be allocated to hardware and software.

# 6.4.6.2

The allocation and partitioning decisions shall comply with the system architectural design.

NOTE To achieve independence and to avoid propagation of failures, the system architectural design can implement the partitioning of functions and components.

# 6.4.6.3

Each system architectural design element shall inherit the highest ASIL from the technical safety requirements that it implements.

# 6.4.6.4

If a system architectural design element is comprised of sub-elements with different ASILs assigned, or of safety-related and non-safety-related sub-elements, then each of these shall be treated in accordance with the highest ASIL, unless the criteria for coexistence (in accordance with ISO 26262-9:2018, Clause 6) are met.

© ISO 2018 – All rights reserved
---
# ISO 26262-4:2018(E)

# 6.4.6.5

If technical safety requirements are allocated to custom hardware elements that incorporate programmable behaviour (such as ASICs, FPGA or other forms of digital hardware) an adequate development process, combining requirements from ISO 26262-5 and ISO 26262-6, shall be defined and implemented.

NOTE 1: The evidence of compliance with an allocated safety requirement for some of those hardware elements can be provided through evaluation methods in accordance with ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 13, if the criteria for applying this clause are met.

NOTE 2: Guidance can be found in ISO 26262-11:2018.

# 6.4.7 Hardware-software interface (HSI) specification

# 6.4.7.1

The HSI specification shall specify the hardware and software interaction and be consistent with the technical safety concept. The HSI specification shall include the component's hardware parts that are controlled by software and hardware resources that support the execution of the software.

- d) the access mechanism to hardware devices; and
- EXAMPLE 4: Serial, parallel, slave, master/slave.
- e) the timing constraints derived from the technical safety concept.

# 6.4.7.3

The relevant diagnostic capabilities of the hardware, and their use by the software, shall be specified in the HSI specification:

- a) the hardware diagnostic features shall be defined; and
- EXAMPLE: Detection of over-current, short-circuit or over-temperature.
- b) the diagnostic features concerning the hardware, to be implemented in software, shall be defined.

# 6.4.7.4

The HSI shall be specified during the system architectural design.

NOTE: The HSI is refined during hardware development (see ISO 26262-5:2018, Clause 6) and during software development (see ISO 26262-6:2018, Clause 6).

# 6.4.8 Production, operation, service and decommissioning

# 6.4.8.1

The requirements addressed in ISO 26262-7:2018 for production, operation, service and decommissioning, identified during the system architectural design, shall be specified. These include:

f) measures for decommissioning.

EXAMPLE Assembly or disassembly instructions, service notes, instructions regarding permitted repair for system elements, decommissioning instructions, labelling of elements.

NOTE There are two main aspects that ensure functional safety during production, operation, service and decommissioning. The first aspect relates to those activities that ensure an adequate system architectural design and the specification of suitable safety-related special characteristics during the development phase, which are given in requirement 6.4.8.1, while the second aspect relates to those activities that ensure the achievement or maintenance of functional safety during the production and operation phase (e.g. based on specified safety-related special characteristics), which are addressed in ISO 26262-7:2018.

# 6.4.8.2

Diagnostic features shall be specified in order to provide the required data that enables field monitoring for the item or its elements according to ISO 26262-2:2018, Clause 7, with consideration being given to the results of safety analyses and the implemented safety mechanisms.

# 7.4 Requirements and recommendations

# 7.4.1 Specification of integration and test strategy

# 7.4.1.1

To provide evidence that the system architectural design is compliant with the functional safety and technical safety requirements, integration testing activities shall be performed in accordance with ISO 26262-8:2018, Clause 9 to check:

1. the correct implementation of functional safety and technical safety requirements;
2. the correct functional performance, accuracy and timing of safety mechanisms;
3. the consistent and correct implementation of interfaces; and
4. adequate robustness.

# 7.4.1.2

An integration and test strategy shall be defined that considers the system architectural design specification, the functional safety concept and the technical safety concept. It shall address:

1. the test goals suitable to provide evidence for functional safety; and
2. the integration and testing of the item and its elements that contribute to the safety concepts.

© ISO 2018 – All rights reserved
---
# ISO 26262-4:2018(E)

NOTE This includes elements of other technologies that contribute to the safety concepts.

# 7.4.1.3

To enable the item integration sub-phase, the following shall be performed based on the integration and test strategy:

- a) the item integration and test strategy shall be defined for the hardware-software integration and testing;
- b) the item integration and test strategy shall be defined to include the specification of integration tests for the system and vehicle-levels. It shall ensure that open issues from hardware-software verifications are addressed;
- c) the item integration and test strategy shall consider interfaces between vehicle systems (both internal and external to the item) and the environment; and
- d) the item integration and test strategy shall consider if systems or elements are being integrated that were developed as safety element out of context (SEooC) and if the assumptions made during that development need to be verified.

NOTE The specification of the integration and the verification carried out at the hardware-software integration level and the item level considers the interface and the interaction between hardware and software.

# 7.4.1.4

If the system is configurable (e.g. by variance of elements or calibration data), then the verification at the system or vehicle level shall provide evidence of compliance with safety requirements for the configurations at implementation-level intended for series production.

NOTE Testing a justified subset of configurations may be sufficient.

# 7.4.1.5

The fulfilment of each functional safety and technical safety requirement shall be verified (if applicable by testing) at least once in the complete integration sub-phase.

NOTE 1 A common practice is to verify a safety requirement at the next higher level of integration to which it has been specified.

NOTE 2 When a SEooC is integrated in a safety-related system, validity of assumptions used for its development is also verified.

NOTE 3 Safety anomalies identified during integration testing are reported in accordance with ISO 26262-2:2018, 5.4.3.

# 7.4.1.6

To enable the appropriate specification of test cases for the integration tests, test cases shall be derived using an appropriate combination of methods, as listed in Table 3, and by considering the integration level.

c A back-to-back test compares the responses of the test object with the responses of a simulation model to the same stimuli, to detect differences between the behaviour of the model and its implementation.

NOTE The differences in the level of effort applied for Method 1b in Table 4 and Table 9 result from the amount of effort needed to conduct fault injection tests at the system level.

b A performance test can verify the performance (e.g. task scheduling, timing, power output) in the context of the whole test object, and can verify the ability of the intended control software to run with the hardware.

# 7.4.2.2.4

This requirement applies to ASIL (A), B, C, and D. Evidence for the consistent and correct implementation of the external and internal interfaces at the hardware-software level shall be provided by using test methods listed in Table 6.

a At the vehicle level, resource usage testing is usually performed in dynamic environments (e.g. electronic control unit network environments, prototypes or whole vehicles). Issues to test include item internal resources, power consumption, or limited resources of other vehicle systems.

b A stress test verifies the correct operation of the vehicle under high operational loads or high demands from the environment. Therefore tests under high loads on the vehicle or with extreme user inputs or requests from other systems as well as tests with extreme temperatures, humidity, or mechanical shocks can be applied.

c A test for interference resistance and robustness, under certain environmental conditions, is a special case of stress testing. This includes EMC and ESD tests (e.g. see References [4], [5], [6], [7]).

d A long-term test and a user test under real-life conditions are similar to tests derived from field experience but use a larger sample size, normal users as testers, and are not bound to prior specified test scenarios, but performed under real-life conditions during everyday life.

# 8.3.1 Prerequisites

The following information shall be available:

- hazard analysis and risk assessment report in accordance with ISO 26262-3:2018, 6.5.1; and
- functional safety concept in accordance with ISO 26262-3:2018, 7.5.1.

# 8.3.2 Further supporting information

The following information can be considered:

- technical safety concept (see 6.5.2);
- item definition (see ISO 26262-3:2018, 5.5.1); and
- safety analyses report (see 6.5.7).

# 8.4 Requirements and recommendations

# 8.4.1 Safety validation environment

# 8.4.1.1

The safety goals shall be validated for the item in a representative context at vehicle level.

NOTE 1 This integrated item includes, where applicable: system, software, hardware, elements of other technologies, external measures.

NOTE 2 This is especially important for T&B where different base vehicle types could be the subject of a safety validation.

# 8.4.1.2

For the definition of a representative context, representative vehicles based on vehicle types and vehicle configurations shall be considered.

NOTE A relevant input for the choice of representative vehicles might be the hazard analysis and risk assessment report (see ISO 26262-3:2018, 6.5.1).

# 8.4.1.3

Safety goals shall be validated giving consideration to variance in operation that impacts the technical characteristics, which have been considered in the hazard analysis and risk assessment.

# 8.4.2 Specification of safety validation

# 8.4.2.1

The safety validation specification shall be defined, including:

- a) the configuration of the item subjected to safety validation including its calibration data in accordance with ISO 26262-6:2018, Annex C;

NOTE If a complete safety validation of each item configuration is not feasible, then a reasonable subset can be selected.
- b) the specification of safety validation procedures, test cases, driving manoeuvres, and acceptance criteria; and
- c) the equipment and the required environmental conditions.

# ISO 26262-4:2018(E)

# 8.4.3 Execution of safety validation

# 8.4.3.1

If testing is used for safety validation, then the same requirements as provided for verification testing (see ISO 26262-8:2018, 9.4.2 and 9.4.3) may be applied.

# 8.4.3.2

The achievement of functional safety for the item when being integrated into the vehicle shall be validated by evaluating the following aspects:

- a) the controllability;
- NOTE 1 Controllability can be validated using operating scenarios, including intended use and foreseeable misuse.

NOTE 2 One acceptance criteria for the safety validation might be a sufficient controllability in a safe state defined in ISO 26262-3:2018, 7.4.2.5.

b) the effectiveness of the external measures;
- c) the effectiveness of the elements of other technologies; and
- d) assumptions that influence the ASIL in the hazard analysis and risk assessment (see ISO 26262-3:2018, 6.4.4.4) that can be checked only in the final vehicle.

EXAMPLE If a mechanical component is assumed to prevent or mitigate a specific hazard potentially caused by a malfunction of an E/E system, the effectiveness of this component to prevent or mitigate that hazard is validated at the vehicle level.

# 8.4.3.3

The safety validation at the vehicle level, based on the safety goals, the functional safety requirements and the intended use, shall be executed as planned using:

- a) the safety validation procedures and test cases for each safety goal including detailed pass/fail criteria; and

# Annex B

# (informative)

# Example contents of hardware-software interface (HSI)

# B.1 General

This annex provides further explanation on the HSI. The specification of the HSI is initiated during the sub-phase “Technical safety concept.” The HSI specification is refined as development continues through the hardware and software development.

Figure B.1 is an overview of the role of the HSI and its relationship between product development at the system, hardware and software level. The HSI is used to agree technical dependencies between hardware and software development.

NOTE Within the figure, the specific clauses of each part of ISO 26262 are indicated in the following manner: “m-n”, where “m” represents the number of the part and “n” indicates the number of the clause, e.g. “3-6” represents ISO 26262-3:2018, Clause 6.

# B.2 HSI elements

To aid the specification of the HSI, the following HSI elements can be considered:

- memory:
- volatile memory (e.g. RAM);
- non-volatile memory (e.g. NvRAM);
- bus interfaces [e.g. controller area network (CAN), local interconnect network (LIN), internal high-speed serial link (HSSL)];
- converter:
- A/D converter;
- D/A converter;
- pulse-width modulation (PWM);
- multiplexer;
- electrical I/O;
- watchdog:
- internal;
- external.

# B.3 HSI characteristics

To aid the specification of the HSI, the following characteristics of the HSI can be considered:

- interrupts;
- timing consistency;
- data integrity;
- initialization:
- memory and registers;
- boot management;
- message transfer:
- send message;
- receive message;
- network modes:
- sleeping;
- awakening;
- memory management:
- reading;
- writing;
